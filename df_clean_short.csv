"The heroin substitute methadone can be used as a way of weaning addicts off heroin but the substitute can also become addictive.Earlier this year a debate broke out in Scotland when Professor Neil McKeganey, director of the Centre for Drug Misuse Research at the University of Glasgow, said more effort was needed to get people off drugs, including methadone, through abstinence. But a group of 40 specialists, including university professors and doctors who treat addicts, responded: ""If policy makers were to heed the critics' advice to close down methadone treatment or impose an arbitrary time limit on its administration, the community can anticipate more overdose deaths, more HIV and more crime."" So what do recovering addicts think? Chris used methadone for five years to help wean him off heroin but felt he had to quit the drug substitute last October""I just thought, I've got to get a grip here, because I've been in and out of prison since I was 16 - that's half my life,"" he told The Report.  Chris,  an inmate of HMP Edinburgh, lives in Ratho Hall, a specialist Addiction Support Area that helps prisoners achieve abstinence.  ""I heard about Ratho Hall, and it's given me the wake-up call that I needed,"" he said.  Chris was prescribed methadone, a synthetic opiate that is taken orally, to wean him off his heroin addiction but although methadone can help addicts stabilise their lives, it is also addictive.         Ratho Hall is the only facility of its kind in Scotland.  It opened last year in brand new accommodation.  Of the 30 inmates resident last week, 11 have become completely drug-free.  The Scottish government produced its strategy document on drugs, The Road to Recovery, in 2008.  In this, the Community Safety Minister, Fergus Ewing of the SNP, explained how he wants to see ""a new vision"" for Scotland ""where all drug treatment and rehabilitation services are based on the principle of recovery."" This is a shift away from an acceptance that people will stay on methadone for lengthy periods of time unchallenged.  Chris, who started to use heroin when he was 18, talked of his own addiction: ""When you're on heroin or methadone your head's hazy.  I realised when I was on methadone that I was just putting my life on hold.  ""Now I feel that abstinence is a walk in the park compared to taking drugs.  When you're abstinent you can just be yourself - it's a weight off your shoulders.""Chris said he could not have done it on his own.  In Ratho Hall, there are drug counsellors, regular peer-support meetings and medical staff.  Paul Davidson, unit manager of Ratho Hall, explained how the unit works.  ""If guys come in here on a methadone prescription, they have to have a reduction plan.  ""So they'll be reduced at a rate they feel comfortable with and the doctor feels is right for them.""  Around one in five prisoners in Scotland is being prescribed methadone.  But across the whole of Scotland it is estimated that 22,000 people are taking methadone.  Some of them may have been on it for decades.  In England more than 150,000 people are receiving a substitute drug treatment for their addiction, normally methadone.  Maxie Richards, a committed Christian has been helping addicts get clean since 1986, and is a firm believer in abstinence.  Her suburban Glasgow home is an unlikely venue for drug rehabilitation. ""The majority of those I see now want to come off methadone.  And it's harder to come off than heroin, it's so sad.  ""It's also a very debilitating drug too, and can lead to memory loss,"" she explained.James Boyd, one of the addicts who came to Maxie Richards for help, looks fit and well, but when he arrived on her doorstep in June, he was three stone lighter.""I thought death would be better than the way I was feeling.  What methadone does to you is wrecks you physically, mentally and spiritually.  ""I said to myself, I can't do this any more.  Every single person I know is on heroin and they are all on methadone too.""James stopped methadone and all other drugs nearly two months ago.  He thinks he has got over the withdrawal symptoms now.""It's just two weeks ago that I had my first full night's sleep.""Another former addict - Gail - is looking forward to a drug-free life.  She is slowly reducing her methadone dose with the support of her doctor.  Gail has been taking methadone for eight years.  ""A lot of addicts use methadone as a backup plan - so when you can't get hold of any drugs, you've got something to hold you.  ""I was taking heroin on top of my methadone.  Then I took half of it and used to sell the rest, which I know is wrong.""  Eighteen months ago, Gail started to take methadone as it was prescribed.""When I stopped injecting and started to take my full prescription, that's when I started to feel the benefit of methadone.  ""I could get up in the morning, do the housework, and attend the appointments I'd made.  For the first time in many years, Gail is planning for her future with the help of the charity Centrepoint in Edinburgh.  She wants to go into a drug rehabilitation centre to make sure she overcomes her addiction once and for all.  Then she aims to find a job.  And it is her methadone prescription that is keeping her away from heroin.

"A 20-tonne bridge is being hauled into place by hand because its remote location makes it impossible to use a crane.The new bridge across Bracklinn Falls, near Callander, is expected to be fully in place by Sunday.The wood and copper structure had to be built on site as the thick woodland also meant helicopters could not be used in the construction.The original steel bridge was washed away by floods in August 2004.Very heavy rain in that month also destroyed bridges in nearby Braeleny and Edinample, near Lochearnhead.Kenny Auld, from Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park, said building the £110,000 bridge had been an ""exceptionally difficult task"".""It's a 20m span across a very deep gorge,"" he said.""For the last six years the community and the national park have been trying to get a replacement in place.""I've taken three batches of Royal Engineers to the site and they've just laughed in my face and told me I'm crazy.""The national park had to build a small access road to the site to transport materials, but it is only accessible to four-wheel drives or quad bikes.Engineers from Crief-based Strong Bridges built temporary steel rails across the gorge and mounted the bridge on skids so it could be pulled across.""There's a hand winch on the other side with one or two people winching the 20 tonne bridge across,"" said Mr Auld, who is managing the project for the national park.The bridge is made from Douglas firs from the Heritage Plantation in Dunkeld and has a copper roof.When in place, it will give an ""iconic view"" of the falls, Mr Auld said.The project has been funded by the national park, the Forth Valley and Lomond Leader and Scottish Natural Heritage and was built in partnership with Callander Community Development Trust.The trust's John Snodin said people in Callander had lobbied for a new bridge ever since the old one was washed away six years ago.""Both locals and tourists visit the site daily and the new bridge will be a destination in itself as well as a position to view the cataracts, which are impressive.""The bridge is only a short distance from the car park but it can also be utilised to create a series of longer circuits in the Callander area.""

"Even after an eruption alert was issued and most villagers on the slopes of Java's Mount Merapi had been evacuated, 83-year old Mbah (grandfather) Maridjan stayed put. The spiritual ""guardian"" of the mountain, his battle to tame one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes ended on Wednesday when he was buried by the mountain's thick ash.He was reportedly found dead in a prayer position in his house, as rescuers also dug out more than two dozen more victims in the area - many who had also refused to leave.In the wake of the eruption, houses and fields were left blanketed in thick, white ash, while leaves had been singed off trees.Villagers say they will mourn the loss of a respected elder who was as important to them as the mountain itself. The mountain is seen as sacred in the region, seen as the home of ancient Javanese spirits.Located on the outskirts of the city of Yogyakarta on Java Island, it regularly causes small eruptions in the area.For years Maridjan had led ceremonies at the volcano, dispersing rice or flowers in or around the crater in an effort to appease spirits. Maridjan believed he had a duty to the late sultan of Yogyakarta, Hamengkubuwono IX, who had appointed him for this purpose.If there were to be an eruption, many villagers believed Maridjan would be warned in a vision. Local beliefs are a mix of Islam, Indonesia's most predominant religion, and those dating from the island's Hindu-Buddhist period.One tradition is the annual Labuhan ceremony, an auspicious event where the palace makes offerings to spirits, including the Goddess of the South Sea, Kanjeng Ratu Kidul.It was Marijan who helped ensure such rituals were upheld.It is not the first time the old man had defied warnings from the authorities about the volcano. In 2006, when Mt Merapi last erupted, Maridjan even went closer to the crater, to meditate.  At the time, he told one journalist: ""I'm not afraid because it's my duty.""I'm like a soldier - they are never scared,"" he added. Perhaps it came as less of a surprise then, when this time, despite government warnings, Mbah Maridjan decided that it was important to stay.One rescue worker said that Maridjan was adamant in his refusal to leave his home village of Kinahrejo, just 5km (three miles) from the crater.""I'm so used to being at home, it's better for me to just stay here and pray,"" Maridjan reportedly told him.A journalist meanwhile perished trying to warn the old man to leave, according to local reports.Maridjan was not the only one who could not bring themselves to leave, and rescuers say they fear the death toll may rise.""I keep thinking about what's happening up there, with my cows, my property,"" said Hadi Sumarmo, who has a farm in Srumbung, a village 5km from the crater's mouth. ""I just want to go back to check. If I hear sirens, I'll get out again quickly.""For many survivors, the region will not be the same without their spiritual protector.""To us, Maridjan is as important as Merapi. Now that he's no longer around, who's going to look after Merapi?"" Wanto, 56, a farmer, told AFP news agency.""What happens if there's another eruption?""But, according to the Jakarta Globe, it was not a shock to the Yogyakarta palace, who had been warned of Maridjan's fate from a premonition.""We had known long before it happened that Mbah Maridjan would be taken by Merapi,"" the newspaper quoted Gusti Prabukusumo, the brother of the current sultan, as saying.""Now that he's gone, we have to choose a new gatekeeper soon.""",Spiritual guardian of Indonesian volcano dies,Asia-Pacific,"The BBC's Olivia Lang reports on Mbah Maridjan, the spiritual guardian of Indonesia's Mount Merapi volcano, who died trying to tame nature's force.",BBC News

"Think of someone with a sexually transmitted infection (STI) and the chances are you will visualise someone young, the age group that is traditionally targetted in awareness campaigns.But in this week's Scrubbing Up, Linda Bailey from the Royal College of Nursing warns STI's are a growing problem for the over 40s, and that the problem is being ignored. Barely a month goes by without new warnings that the rate of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is rising among the nation's youth.  Chlamydia, syphilis, gonorrhoea, herpes, and genital warts to name just a few are affecting ever-growing numbers with each year that passes. The effects of these infections can range from mild embarrassment through to life-long infertility or in the most serious of cases, premature death.We all know that young people have sex, and unfortunately protection is not always used. Because of this, there is now a plethora of social marketing and advertising campaigns warning teenagers and young adults of the dangers of unprotected sex.But what about the 'older' adults? Do we not count because people assume we no longer have sex? Or is it that being over the age of 40 somehow provides instant immunity to sexually transmitted infections?The truth is times have changed and so has the rate of STIs among older adults. Between 1999 and 2008 the Health Protection Agency reported a 53% increase in gonorrhoea among men aged 45-64 and a 93% increase among women. At the same time, the rate of herpes increased by 130% among this age group. Worryingly, there were also 17,000 new HIV diagnoses.While the incidence of STIs among older adults may be small compared with teenagers and young adults, it is there and it is growing.Sexual freedomThere are an increasing number of people in their 40s, 50s and 60s who are newly single having recently come to the end of a long-term relationship. Many of these people would have also been in secure, stable relationships during the 1980s and impassive to the powerful advertising campaigns that shocked their single friends into protecting themselves from the scourge of HIV and AIDS. Many of these now 'older' adults will have had their first sexual experiences in the relatively safe years before we realised the dawn of Aids was just around the corner. The pill was easily accessible and as teenagers and young people, this generation, felt free to experiment. This group is now once again revelling in sexual freedom, but without the benefit of having ever been the target of public health campaigns to warn them of the dangers. The truth is that infections do not discriminate between 18 or 80 year olds - we all need to be careful.The Department of Health website provides an array of sexual health guidance and leaflets for prisoners, drug users, young men, young women, gay and bi-sexual men, people from black and ethnic communities and sex workers. These people all have needs and their needs are very important. However there is a huge gap in information aimed at people like myself who are single, straight, of a certain age and sexually active. It appears that sex in the over-40s just doesn't happen, or if it does it isn't talked about. There are many excellent campaigns out there to alert the nation's youth to the dangers of unprotected sex. But unfortunately cartoon characters and street slang just don't speak to people like me. Times have changed and sex no longer belongs to the younger generation. We should be embracing the fact 40, 50, 60 and beyond is no longer ""past-it"" and celebrate the young and active lifestyles of the older community. However, to keep the sexually liberated over-40s infection-free, which will also ultimately save the NHS money, we need a dedicated awareness campaign which sends out the right messages through the right channels to the right people.Health advice for the over-40s: Your Comments",'Never too old for a sexual infection',Health,"In this week's Scrubbing Up, Linda Bailey from the Royal College of Nursing warns that STI's are a growing problem for the over 40s and that they are being neglected.",BBC News
"US President Barack Obama has staunchly defended controversial plans to build a mosque near Ground Zero in New York.Opponents have protested against the construction of an Islamic cultural centre and mosque several hundred feet away from the site of the Twin Towers.Mr Obama acknowledged ""sensitivities"" surround the 9/11 site, but said Muslims have the same right to practise their religion ""as anyone else"".""Our commitment to religious freedom must be unshakeable,"" Mr Obama said. Since a New York developer announced plans to build a 13-storey Islamic community centre and mosque about two blocks from the former World Trade Center site, prominent Republican politicians and a host of conservative pundits have attacked the project.Some relatives of people killed in the terror attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001 are also opposed to the plan. In a speech at a White House dinner celebrating Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, Mr Obama waded into the row, saying:""We must all recognise and respect the sensitivities surrounding the development of lower Manhattan, Ground Zero is, indeed, hallowed ground. But let me be clear, as a citizen, and as president, I believe that Muslims have the same right to practise their religion as anyone else in this country. ""That includes the right to build a place of worship and a community centre on private property in lower Manhattan, in accordance with local laws and ordinances. This is America, and our commitment to religious freedom must be unshakeable. The principle that people of all faiths are welcome in this country, and will not be treated differently by their government, is essential to who we are.""He told the group of US Congressmen, government officials and foreign dignitaries that America's tradition of religious tolerance distinguishes it from ""our enemies"".""Al-Qaeda's cause is not Islam,"" he said, ""it is a gross distortion of Islam"".Until now Mr Obama had not commented on the mosque row, with the White House saying that the matter was a local issue.In voicing his support for the right to build the centre, Mr Obama joins New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who had been the only prominent politician to endorse it.Opponents of the building project have called for investigations into its backers and financing. In New York, opponents sought unsuccessfully to have the building currently at the mosque site granted landmark protection status, in an effort to hinder development.Former US House of Representatives speaker Newt Gingrich dubbed the plan an ""assertion of Islamist triumphalism"" and has denounced it in speeches.Former Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin wrote that ""to build a mosque at Ground Zero is a stab in the heart of the families of the innocent victims of those horrific attacks"".",Obama defends right to build mosque near 9/11 site,US & Canada,"President Obama defends controversial plans to build a mosque near Ground Zero site saying commitment to religious freedom ""must be unshakeable"".",BBC News

"Love hurts, at least according to many a romantic songwriter, but it may also help ease pain, US scientists suggest.Brain scans suggest many of the areas normally involved in pain response are also activated by amorous thoughts.Stanford University researchers gave 15 students mild doses of pain, while checking if they were distracted by gazing at photos of their beloved.The study focused on people early in a romance, journal PLoS One reported, so the ""drug of love"" may wear off.The scientists who carried out the experiment used ""functional magnetic resonance imaging"" (fMRI) to measure activity in real-time in different parts of the brain.It has been known for some time that strong feelings of love are linked to intense activity in several different brain regions.These include areas linked to the brain chemical dopamine, which produces the brain's feel-good state following certain stimulants - from eating sweets to taking cocaine.The Stanford University researchers had noticed that when we feel pain, some of the same areas ""light up"" on the scans - and wondered whether one might affect the other.They recruited a dozen students who were all in the first nine months of a relationship, defined as ""the first phase of intense love"".Each was asked to bring in a picture of the object of their affection and photos of what they deemed an equally attractive acquaintance.While their brains were scanned, they were shown these pictures, while a computer controlled heat pad placed in the palm of their hand was set up to cause them mild pain.They found that viewing the picture of their beloved reduced perceptions of pain much more than looking at the image of the acquaintance.Dr Jarred Younger, one of the researchers involved, said that the ""love-induced analgesia"" appeared to involve more primitive functions of the brain, working in a similar way to opioid painkillers.""One of the key sites is the nucleus accumbens, a key reward addiction centre for opioids, cocaine and other drugs of abuse.""The region tells the brain that you really need to keep doing this.""Professor Paul Gilbert, a neuropsychologist from the University of Derby, said that the relationship between emotional states and the perception of pain was clear.He said: ""One example is a footballer who has suffered quite a painful injury, but who is able to continue playing because of his emotionally charged state.""He added that while the effect noticed by the Stanford researchers might only be short-lived in the early stages of a love affair, it may well be replaced by something similar later in a relationship, with a sense of comfort and wellbeing generating the release of endorphins.""It's important to recognise that people who feel alone and depressed may have very low pain thresholds, whereas the reverse can be true for people who feel secure and cared for.""This may well be an issue for the health service, as patients are sometimes rushed through the system, and perhaps there isn't this focus on caring that might have existed once.""","Love can ease pain, say brain researchers",Health,"The euphoria of being in love may directly influence how much pain we feel, according to US researchers.",BBC News

He was found guilty of five charges but cleared of the sixth, at an earlier hearing.Robinson had said he did not have sex with the girl until her 16th birthday.Hereford Crown Court had earlier been told that the charges related to events between November 2006 and May 2007.West Mercia Police said it was pleased with the sentence.It said it reflected Robinson's abuse of his position of trust as a teacher and the traumatic effect on the girl.Robinson had admitted having a relationship with the teenager, who cannot be named, but told the court they ""fell in love"".The girl had been in a ""depressive"" state and he thought he could help her, the court heard. He insisted the relationship had been platonic until she turned 16.Robinson was suspended from his job in January 2007 when rumours began to circulate about the relationship and a police investigation was subsequently launched.Robinson, who taught personal, social and health education, which included sex education, and science, was 38 at the time of the offences.",Teacher jailed for under-age sex in Worcestershire,Hereford & Worcester,A teacher is jailed for four years for having sex with a 15-year-old schoolgirl in Worcestershire.,BBC News
"This is the image greeting travellers at the border. Behind the barbed wire snaking up the hillside, the huge portraits of Ayatollahs Khomeini and Khamenei dominate the valley.   This is the border between Iran and Turkey. The Esendere crossing, one of just a handful of official transit points between the two countries, is in a dusty valley high up in the mountains. A guard unlocks the padlock to swing open the big metal gate and an Iranian couple head towards the Iranian customs point. All morning there is a slow but steady flow of people.  Many of them are small traders like Abduluahap Derinsu. He is waiting to cross.""We buy Iranian vegetables and fruit, like kiwi fruit and water melons. And we sell Turkish fabrics and clothes,"" says the 26-year-old. He crosses into Iran most days. ""I don't make much money, and the Iranians make us pay all sorts of charges.  But I don't have a choice - there's no other work round here, no factories. I have to feed a family of 15.""""Iran's isolation could mean new opportunities for our border region,"" says Osman Celik, the deputy chairman of Van Provincial Chamber of Commerce, as he shows off the commemorative plates from his last trip to Iran.He travels to Iran regularly with delegations of local Turkish businessmen. ""If it was down to us, we wouldn't listen to any US or UK embargo - we would just do our business. But there are certain lines you just can't cross. Some problems need to be sorted out at a government level.""Last year, trade between Turkey and Iran was worth US $10bn, and they're hoping it will be doubled by 2011. More than 60% of Turkey's exports go to European countries. So as the government in Ankara, led by the Islamist-rooted AK Party, reaches out to its neighbour, does it risk alienating its traditional allies in the West?""Our prime minister, Mr Erdogan is like a man with two wives -  he wants to please both sides, until one side says enough is enough,"" says Cuneyt Ulsever, a writer and columnist with Hurriyet newspaper. ""I believe in the end, he will face America and turn his back on Iran.""   ""Turkey voted against the UN sanctions, but she's going to have to abide by them. So formally Turkey will probably give the impression to the world that she's abiding by them."" ""But the illegal trading will probably gain some power, and people in the border will find a way to help their Iranian friends.""In the Iranian bazaar in the border town of Yuksekova, everything has come across the border - and much of it has not come through formal channels. In the cramped shops off the long dark corridor Iranian carpets are stacked up, shelves are crammed with Iranian teapots, bags of Iranian sugar vie for space on the floor with Iranian suitcases, and trays of Iranian veterinary medicines sit out in the passageway. One Iranian businessman says he can transfer anything overnight to Iran across the mountains, even a machine as big as a bulldozer.  Rafat Kaya is a Kurdish shepherd from southeastern Turkey. Sometimes, he says, he smuggles goods back and forward to Iran. He points to the mountains and says it take eight hours on horseback from his village to the border. And that's something we keep hearing, locals in both Turkey and Iran know how to avoid border controls. We're told they either pay off customs officials or they take one of the many goat-paths and unofficial routes that cross this 298 miles (480km) mountainous border. So could Turkey ever really be sure exactly what it exports to its neighbour?   What else is being taken into Iran under the radar?Back in Istanbul - the heart of Turkey's booming economy - the district of Aksaray is where Iranians head for if they are looking for Iranian travel agents, Iranian restaurants, Iranian shops and Iranian cargo houses.  It looks like a street in Tehran. A few blocks away, an Iranian dealer agrees to talk to me.   His desk is messy, but he does serious business here. He introduces himself as Mahmud, on the surface, he says, his business is legal. But, he adds, just 10% of his goods go to Iran legally.  ""I export strategic equipment, like aeroplane parts, to Iran,"" Mahmud says as he draws on a cigarette.""Those companies would never sell their goods to Iran - because they have American investors."" He candidly explains how it works.""How do we do it?  A company like mine - we buy the equipment under the name of a Turkish company and the paperwork shows the destination is another country.

"Cycle lanes have become a familiar feature of city streets in the UK but from Monday, London is raising its game - opening bright blue ""superhighways"" for those putting toe to pedal. But is this a shade of things to come, or just a route to nowhere?Colliers Wood, on the jam-packed A24 and near a huge supermarket saver-centre, seems an improbable place to start a revolution. But just across from the Tube entrance, on the opposite side of the road, a 1.5m-wide painted blue lane has appeared. It is labelled ""CS7"" in white paint and stretches for 8.5 miles along a busy commuter route from this south London suburb into the city centre. It's one of two new superhighways to open this summer. The other goes between Barking, east London, and Tower Gateway, which is near Tower Bridge. Twelve such routes are planned in all, with details and maps available on the Transport for London website.Along with a forthcoming city-wide bike hire scheme, a new cycling police unit, 66,000 extra bike parking spaces before 2012 and better strategic planning, the hope of Mayor Boris Johnson is that they will spark what he calls a ""cycling revolution"". His transport adviser Kulveer Ranger says: ""People think 'cycling revolution' and think of the hire scheme, superhighways... but it's a lot more than that. ""Boris wants to see the culture around cycling evolving - we have to look at the infrastructure, securing bikes, cyclists' safety and embed cycling in transport policy.""Schemes like the London cycling network - a range of routes across the city - were good, he says, but they didn't look strategically at where people needed to go.The London Cycling Campaign (LCC) estimates there are 550,000 cycle journeys in London daily. Transport for London (TfL) says that is an increase from around 250,000 in 2000 and it wants to increase it further, to help reduce pollution and relieve over-crowding on public transport and road congestion. The city's transport body wants to make the roads safer - there were 13 cyclist fatalities in 2009 in the capital. Its aim is to attract those put off by accident statistics and direct them towards continuous, well-marked and maintained, straight-forward commuting routes. So what are the new lanes like to cycle and can they fulfil their aims? An inauspicious start at 8am on a rush-hour morning signals a ""no"". Before you can answer the question: ""Can you cycle easily along the superhighway?"" you need to negotiate another: ""Can you even pull out into it?""With congestion at its height, there are lorries, buses, cars, vans and motorbikes everywhere, across both lanes of this main road, blocking the flash new textured surface on the left hand side. The traffic swarms under the leaden skies of an ugly summer's day. It's raining persistently and the wind gusts. Average British cycling conditions perhaps, but not the best for tempting would-be converts to the cause. But once the traffic blockade is negotiated, and the road begins to widen out a mile further north, it's actually quite a fast route, if you wriggle round the manhole covers. Often cyclists seek out quieter back roads for their journey, avoiding the heavy traffic and its dangers but adding ""long-cuts"". This, however feels like a direct A to B. With the adrenaline pumping and that ET cycle-sequence feeling of bikers all around, it's easy to get carried away with enthusiasm. But, hold the handlebars, isn't this just a glorified cycle lane?Perhaps, but it is a precious thing in the UK's towns and cities - a glorified cycle lane of considerable length, in a purposeful direction, stripped of street furniture and not finishing abruptly without explanation.At the frequent stops for traffic lights, what do the cyclists think of it?Liza Houghton is a bold woman - cycling her one-year-old son in a child seat to his childminder via quieter roads before commuting to work on the superhighway.""They're absolutely brilliant, anything that helps cyclists and makes it safer has to be a good thing,"" she says. ""Cars are being forced to become more aware of cyclists. It's not that safe, you have to be really careful - the close shaves I've had have been with people on their mobile phones."" She draws comparisons with London's European capital cousins. The UK still compares negatively with the cycling ""dream"" of Berlin or Amsterdam, but is better than ""disastrous"" Paris.Others carry their cyclists' insouciance well. Many of those gathered in the bike box at junctions - that space marked with a bike symbol that cars and vans creep into - say they notice little difference and question the benefits.Tony Dann, a former cycle courier with 14 years' experience riding in London, ""can't really see the point"".""They're on the main roads, the traffic's exactly the same as it always has been, there's nothing to stop cars from going in the lanes. I think it gives inexperienced cyclists a false sense of security.""The £23m spent to research the scheme and set up the first of the 12 lanes is ""a waste of money"" he believes. But, he admits, he has no better plan. To the right, some taxi drivers say they find the extra road markings confusing, especially when they fall in a bus lane - how much room should they give?There is no verdict from the van drivers whose windows are wound up against the pelting rain. The blurb from TfL about the lanes makes much of the fact they continue through junctions - but that does nothing to stop some trucks and vans repeatedly turning left and cutting across the cyclists.It's here that the LCC would like to see more investment, they want the city's massive one way junctions returned to two-way traffic and speed limits reduced. ""We're disappointed it's not doing more, but investment has to continue,"" says spokesman Tom Bogdanowicz.At Southwark Bridge, after 45 minutes of cycling, some success lies in crossing the River Thames into the City still in one piece. Not without becoming lost, however - at one of London's most intimidating junctions, Elephant and Castle, the route takes a swing through the back roads but this cyclist missed the cues. Could these routes encourage beginners? Perhaps. The lanes look wide, but they are advisory, not enforced, and shared with the lorries, buses, more experienced cyclists - many can be unforgiving of mistakes.  What cyclists hope they may provide is a highlighted and publicised route where they can come together in a critical mass - that could one day grant them equal reckoning with the bigger beasts of the road.

" The first direct evidence of a genetic link to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder has been found, a study says.Scientists from Cardiff University, writing in The Lancet, said the disorder was a brain problem like autism - not due to bad parenting.They analysed stretches of DNA from 366 children who had been diagnosed with the disorder.But other experts agued ADHD was caused by a mixture of genetic and environmental factors.At least 2% of children in the UK are thought to have attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).Affected children are restless and impulsive. They may also have destructive tendencies, and experience serious problems at school and within family life.The researchers compared genetic samples from ADHD children, with DNA from 1,047 people without the condition.They found that 15% of the ADHD group had large and rare variations in their DNA - compared with 7% in the control group.Professor Anita Thapar said: ""We found that, compared with the control group, the children with ADHD have a much higher rate of chunks of DNA that are either duplicated or missing.""This is really exciting - because it gives us the first direct genetic link to ADHD. ""We have looked at lots of potential risk factors in the environment - such as parenting or what happens before birth - but there isn't the evidence to say they're linked to ADHD.""There's a lot of public misunderstanding about ADHD. Some people say it's not a real disorder, or that it's the result of bad parenting.""Finding this direct link should address the issue of stigma.""The researchers stressed that there is no single gene behind ADHD, and the work is at too early a stage to lead to any test for the disorder.But they hope the study will help unravel the biological basis of ADHD. This could eventually lead to new treatments.The work was largely funded by the Wellcome Trust, with extra support from the Medical Research Council. The chief executive of a charity and support group ADDIS, Andrea Bilbow, said: ""We are very excited. We've always known there was a genetic link - through studies and anecdotally.""This paper will help us deal more confidently with the sceptics, who are always so eager to blame parents or teachers. It shows there is a definite genetic anomaly in children with ADHD.""But the study has been criticised by some experts.Professor Tim Kendall, a director of the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, said a number of factors caused ADHD and blaming it purely on genetics could mean incorrect treatments.""I'm pretty sure these studies are not going to produce undoubtable evidence that ADHD is caused solely genetically. ""I am saying it's a mixture of genetic and environmental factors, and the important thing is that we don't end up thinking this is a biological problem which is only subject to biological treatments like Ritalin.""Oliver James, a clinical child psychologist and broadcaster, cited studies which looked at the effect of anxiety among pregnant women, and disturbed early relations between mothers and their babies.He said: ""Only 57 out of the 366 children with ADHD had the genetic variant supposed to be a cause of the illness.""That would suggest that other factors are the main cause in the vast majority of cases.""Genes hardly explain at all why some kids have ADHD and not others.""",New study claims ADHD 'has a genetic link',Health,Researchers say they have found the first direct evidence of a genetic link to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.,BBC News

"Two High Court judges hearing a challenge to ex-minister Phil Woolas's re-election as an MP have reserved their judgement until October.Legal arguments were heard on the final day of the specially convened election court in Oldham on Thursday.Mr Woolas won his Oldham East and Saddleworth seat by just 103 votes in May's general election.Defeated Lib Dem rival Elwyn Watkins says the vote was swayed by false claims in Labour leaflets.His counsel has accused former immigration minister Mr Woolas of stirring up racial tension by running a ""risky"" campaign designed to ""galvanise the white Sun vote"" against Mr Watkins, because he was convinced he was going to lose his seat.Mr Watkins has accused his opponent of implying that he was in league with extremist Muslims who wanted to kill the former minister.Mr Woolas has defended the leaflets, saying it was legitimate to ask questions about how his opponent funded his campaign, the political company he kept and where he lived.He has argued that he was targeted by extremists, including receiving death threats, because of the nature of the constituency and his national profile as minister responsible for immigration issues and accused Mr Watkins of not condemning them. The case has been brought under Section 106 of the Representation of the People Act which makes it an offence to publish ""any false statement of fact in relation to the candidate's personal character or conduct"" to prevent them being elected - unless they believed it was true and had ""reasonable grounds"" to do so.It is the first case of its kind in 99 years.

"The Netherlands has ended its military mission in Afghanistan, after four years in which its 1,950 troops have won praise for their effectiveness. Dutch military chief Gen Peter van Uhm said security had improved in Uruzgan province during the Dutch deployment.But he acknowledged that ""a lot still has to happen"" after the withdrawal.Nato has played down its significance, but analysts say this is a sensitive time for the alliance, with growing casualties and doubts about strategy.Dutch command was formally handed over to the US and Australia in a small ceremony on Sunday at the main military base in Uruzgan - where most Dutch soldiers have been deployed.The Dutch ministry of defence told the BBC that while its military mission in Afghanistan had ended, a redeployment task force would stay on to oversee the return of vehicles, military hardware and equipment to the Netherlands. Four F16 jets, three Chinooks and five Apaches from the Dutch air force were expected to remain in Afghanistan until the end of the year.""Dutch forces have served with distinction in Uruzgan, and we honour their sacrifice and that of their Afghan counterparts during the Netherlands' tenure in the province,"" said a statement from the Nato-led International Security Assistance Force (Isaf).Nato had wanted the Netherlands to extend its mission, but the request triggered a political row which brought down the country's coalition government in February.This sent shock waves through other European countries, particularly Germany, where public opposition to the war is growing.More than 145,000 foreign troops currently operate under US and Nato command in Afghanistan and are supporting its Western-backed government against a Taliban-led insurgency that has gained strength.Having supplied just a small percentage of Nato forces, the Dutch pull-out will not make a significant military difference, says the BBC's David Loyn in Kabul, but it will have a symbolic impact far beyond the troop numbers themselves.  Analysts say the Dutch contingent has pioneered techniques which have since been held up as a model for other foreign forces in Afghanistan. These include the ""3D"" policy - defence, diplomacy and development - which involved fighting the Taliban while at the same time building close contacts with local tribal elders and setting up development programmes.""We offer the majority of the population relatively safe living conditions and advancements in health care, education and trade,"" Gen Van Uhm told a news conference on Wednesday. ""We have achieved tangible results of which the Netherlands can be proud.""Uruzgan is a poor mountainous region north of Helmand and Kandahar, and the Dutch lost far fewer troops than the UK, US and Canada, the main forces further south.  Gen Van Uhm said 24 Dutch troops died during the four-year mission and 140 were wounded. His 23-year-old son was killed by a roadside bomb in April 2008.A Taliban spokesman told the Volkskrant newspaper that the group wanted to ""wholeheartedly congratulate the citizens and government of the Netherlands"" for pulling out its troops and urged others to follow suit.Officials in Brussels insist the rest of the military alliance remains solid and note that the decision of the Dutch to go ahead with the withdrawal did not produce a chain reaction of other announcements about pull-outs.But Canada is still expected to withdraw its forces next year, Poland in 2012, and the UK in 2014 or 2015.

"Sweden has cancelled an arrest warrant for Wikileaks founder Julian Assange on accusations of rape and molestation.The Swedish Prosecution Authority website said the chief prosecutor had come to the decision that Mr Assange was not suspected of rape but did not give any further explanation.The warrant was issued late on Friday.Wikileaks, which has been criticised for leaking Afghan war documents, had quoted Mr Assange as saying the claims were ""without basis"".That message, which appeared on Twitter and was attributed directly to Mr Assange, said the appearance of the allegations ""at this moment is deeply disturbing"".In a series of other messages posted on the Wikileaks Twitter feed, the whistle-blowing website said: ""No-one here has been contacted by Swedish police"", and that it had been warned to expect ""dirty tricks"".In its ""official blog"" on Saturday before the warrant was cancelled, Wikileaks said it was ""deeply concerned about the seriousness of these allegations. We the people behind Wikileaks think highly of Julian and and he has our full support"".The current whereabouts of Mr Assange, a 39-year-old Australian, are unclear.The Swedish Prosecution Authority website said chief prosecutor Eva Finne had come to the decision that Julian Assange was not subject to arrest.In a brief statement Eva Finne said: ""I don't think there is reason to suspect that he has committed rape."" The website said there would be no further immediate comment.Earlier, Karin Rosander, communications head at Sweden's prosecutors' office, said there were two separate allegations against Mr Assange, one of rape and the other of molestation. She gave no details of the accusations. She said that as far as she knew they related to alleged incidents that took place in Sweden.On Saturday she said the police investigation into the molestation allegation continued.Ms Rosander said: ""The [chief prosecutor] will look into that later. She hasn't been able to do that, but that's not enough for being arrested. It's not a serious enough crime.""Media reports say Mr Assange was in Sweden last week to talk about his work and defend the decision by Wikileaks to publish the Afghan war logs.Last month, Wikileaks published more than 75,000 secret US military documents on the war in Afghanistan. US authorities criticised the leak, saying it could put the lives of coalition soldiers and Afghans, especially informers, at risk.Mr Assange has said that Wikileaks is intending to release a further 15,000 documents in the coming weeks.",Swedish rape warrant for Wikileaks' Assange cancelled,Europe,An arrest warrant for Wikileaks founder Julian Assange on rape accusations is abruptly cancelled by Swedish authorities just hours after it was issued.,BBC News

"A satellite tracking scheme designed to monitor the movements of violent offenders with mental health problems is being expanded, following a successful pilot.The system is intended to prevent psychiatric patients absconding or offending while on leave from a secure hospital in south-east London. Patients wear a device around an ankle when they attend court and when they are allowed out of hospital on authorised visits, some of which are unaccompanied.Doctors at the Bethlem Royal Hospital in Beckenham say the number of times patients have breached their leave conditions has fallen substantially since the devices were introduced.The satellite tracking system was introduced after Terrence O'Keefe, a mental health patient, went on the run and strangled a man with his belt in March 2008.O'Keefe had been held at a secure unit at Lambeth Hospital and escaped while being treated at King's College Hospital in south London. In June 2009 O'Keefe was found guilty of murdering David Kemp at Great Yarmouth in Norfolk.  The satellite tracking devices have been used by 35 patients at River House, a medium-security psychiatric unit at Bethlem. The unit treats people with severe mental illness and personality disorders, among them convicted killers and sex offenders. Professor Tom Fahy, clinical director of forensic services at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, said the device added an extra layer of safety when patients were allowed out on ""leave"" to prepare them for life in the community.""The main advantage is that it gives us confidence, about the patient's whereabouts, that they're complying with their leave conditions,"" said Prof Fahy, a consultant psychiatrist.""We can... enhance the trusting relationship between the clinical services and the patient.""The device uses three types of technology to pinpoint a patient's location - GPS (global positioning system), GSM (global system for mobile communication) and RF (radio frequency).It sends signals to a control room which alerts the hospital when a patient goes to an area they're excluded from, or is away for too long.  An accelerometer measures whether the tracking device, and therefore the patient, is moving and at what speed.The device vibrates to remind a patient when they're nearing the end of their allotted time away from hospital.""The information is sent from the tracker up to a monitoring station and they can see the information on a map,"" said Sara Murray, who founded Buddi - the company behind the tracking device - after her daughter disappeared from sight at a supermarket.""They can actually live-track somebody, so if somebody is missing they can immediately see where they are and follow them.""One of the patients who used the device while at River House told BBC News that it had helped to keep him ""more safe"".""If I was to have an accident of any kind it would be easier to pick me up,"" said the man, who wanted to be known as Edward to safeguard his anonymity.But Edward, who now lives in a hostel after 13 years in secure hospitals following a conviction for arson, said the tracker was uncomfortable when worn for long periods.""Sometimes it makes you feel a bit childish... almost labelled,"" he said.But Professor Fahy says the satellite tracking system has been successful in cutting the number of times patients have breached their leave conditions.Doctors also hope the system will cut the costs of searching for patients who have absconded . Each device, including straps, costs £374, plus £50 per month per device for monitoring. The unit now has 60 devices and plans to use it on more patients over the coming months.

"The last of 250 British and Australian World War I troops recovered from mass graves has been reburied with full military honours in northern France. Prince Charles and the relatives of identified soldiers attended a commemorative ceremony at the new Fromelles Military Cemetery.It comes 94 years after the soldiers were killed in the Battle of Fromelles. Work to excavate and identify the soldiers began two years ago, after the bodies were discovered. Of the bodies recovered, 205 have now been identified as belonging to Australian soldiers, three served with the British army and 42 are still classified as unknown. The remains of the first soldier were reburied in January.Opening the ceremony to mark the anniversary of the battle, the Duke of Kent, president of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, said the soldiers were ""lost no longer... here, at last, in peace"".Relatives of those killed during the battle paid tribute to their family members, reading moving extracts from diaries and letters home. The last letter from Thomas Sidney Wharfs, to his wife, dated 18 July 1916, said: ""My darling wife I am writing this to be sent to you in case anything happens and I am killed tonight. I have just been ordered to attack tomorrow and I'm taking my company over, in the front line.  ""I am absolutely confident of my men and we'll get through, all correctly but we're certain to have casualties. Cheer up and take care of Dick.  You will need all your strength to bring him up and look after him.  God bless you my darling wife and boy.  I love you with all my heart.""Another Australian relative said: ""My grandfather, Private Frank Flowers, was killed on this day 94 years ago, leaving his wife and three small children. I would like to read a few lines from his last letter to home. ""It may be of help to you to know that every day of my life I pray to God to protect and help you and our children. I pray to him for your sake and for the kiddies' sake that I may be sent back to you, not for my own sake... as I know the heart would go out of your life were I to go under.'""The relative added: ""Thank you, Grandad, for the lives we have been able to live.""During the ceremony, a general service wagon, which had been restored after its use during WWI, carried the last coffin on its poignant journey. Behind it, Prince Charles processed with members of the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery.Following the Last Post and a one-minute silence, the Prince of Wales and the Governor-General of Australia, Quentin Bryce, laid the first wreaths.Dedicating the ceremony, the prince said: ""In laying this last hero to rest, we honour them all.""He continued: ""I am profoundly humbled by the outstanding bravery of these men who fought so valiantly in the indescribable mud and carnage, many thousands of miles from their families and from their homes.""After the reburial of the last unknown soldier, the Prince of Wales, accompanied by the Duchess of Cornwall, attended a reception for relatives.The BBC's Robert Hall said the reburials had ""united families from opposite sides of the world"". He said the Battle of Fromelles - a diversionary tactic in the wider Battle of the Somme - was a ""terrible and bloody encounter"".About 1,700 British servicemen and more than 5,500 Australian soldiers lost their lives in the two-day battle. In the aftermath of the battle, the dead Allied soldiers were buried by their German counterparts. The mass graves were only discovered in 2008. As part of the identification process, overseen by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, experts took DNA samples from the bodies to try to find a family link with the help of the soldiers' relatives. Earlier, the Duke of Kent unveiled a Eurostar train called Remembering Fromelles at St Pancras station, London.

My first assumption was it was the noise that was ripping my face off.""Mr Rathband said after a second shot was fired to his shoulder, emergency crews arrived at the scene.He added: ""I asked a paramedic to tell my wife that I loved her and to tell my children that I loved them.""I knew I was going to die.""Northumbria Police have said they would not comment on the story in the newspaper but that Mr Rathband was interviewed as a victim of a crime, not as a police officer.

"France has begun importing electricity as protesters against pension reforms block fuel depots for a seventh day. Millions of striking workers have poured on to the streets across France ahead of a vote on raising the retirement age later this week. Here three French citizens explain how the strikes, protests and blockades have affected them and what they think of the reforms.There is no petrol left here. They tried to open the refineries and managed to remove all the students and protesters but then they just came back and the refineries had to close again. To make things worse, every morning, protesters are blocking the main line of the town's tram system. The system only has three lines, so it means many of my friends are having to get to work by bike. Everywhere I look there are lots of bikes and although I'm still driving to work, it is taking me much longer than usual. As an English and IT teacher, I will definitely suffer financially from the strikes.Next week, those students who have been managing to attend classes will have run out of petrol and won't be able to get here - and I will have to cancel lessons. The carers and canteen staff at my 10-year-old son's school are on strike which means we can no longer drop him off early at 0730 and collect him late at 1800. All the parents are having to rally round and help each other - sometimes I think it is a bit like the war! My daughter is at university, so is looking after herself but has had to walk there and back a few times now - it takes 80 minutes each way.I have a nasty feeling that Friday will be the worst day. They are gearing up for something big for sure. But there will be no fights breaking out at petrol stations, as everyone I have spoken to is sympathetic with the protesters.The problem is not that we will work until 65 or 67, it is the fact that the upper house of the legislature and the parliament are making no effort whatsoever over their golden pensions. The French find this totally unjust and are striking because once again the government is asking them to work longer for less money, whereas they are working less for more money. The French have had enough.The city where I live is having lots of difficulties. I decided over the weekend to stop using my car, as there is no petrol, and use public transport instead. But today I had to use my car to get to work, because there are no buses. I ran out of petrol earlier and got stuck in a little town next to Rennes with no means of getting back. Luckily my boss came to pick me up. Everything is blocked. Petrol stations are closed and barricaded with shopping trolleys. Bus depots are blocked with huge lorries. I saw a lorry earlier parked across the road, so that nobody would be able to go through. It is complete chaos. When people here decide to strike, they block the entrances to places, it is very radical. I have seen lots of fights in the streets, which is not uncommon. People take it all very seriously, but they also take advantage of the situation and some start drinking and creating trouble. I saw a man with a bloody nose this morning.I am standing right next to a building which has been covered in graffiti. There is graffiti everywhere and the city is normally so nice. People cannot go to work, which means they cannot earn money. Most contracts here are on an hourly rate, so if you do not turn up for whatever the reason - you do not earn a wage. I don't know how long this will continue but ordinary people are badly affected. I was talking to someone who complained about the lack of petrol, but straight after that he said: ""Still, I am happy they are blocking the petrol.""People in this country always take things to the streets and it always works. I am not so sure about it this time round. The government seems to be putting on pressure and this situation cannot continue for too long - we need to work to live.I guess it is like every strike - we need to wait it out, but I think people will get bored with it in the end. We live outside of the Ile-de-France department but work mainly in Paris and the suburbs. We have been completely taken hostage by protesters. Me and my husband both work as English language teachers for companies and universities. Our work is on a freelance basis, so when we do not work, we do not get paid.All the petrol stations in Paris are empty and if this continues for too long, many people and companies will suffer. There are a few where you can buy fuel, but you have to queue for hours.We are lucky because my parents live in a house near Paris, so for the moment we are staying with them. If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't have been able to commute.My husband and I are for the reform to increase the pension age, because we do not have any other choice.

"""I had lost my husband to cancer and for a year and a half I didn't know what to do with myself.  ""I've got to move on, I thought.  So I joined an over-50's dating site.""Jean - not her real name - was soon contacted by a man named ""Alex"", who claimed to be a soldier in the US Army. He said his wife had left him, that he was raising his teenage son alone, and that he was soon leaving for a tour of Afghanistan.""We struck up a friendship, talking by instant message. He said he was going to come and see me. He said all the right things.""Weeks into their blossoming friendship, Alex claimed his son had changed the PIN for his cash card and he was in financial dire straits. Jean offered to help and sent Alex some money. But it wasn't a one-off favour.Costly sob storySpeaking to the 5 live Investigates programme, Jean recalled how Alex's requests for money began to snowball: ""It went on and on. I kept helping him and his son with various things - domestic bills, school fees and things like that.""""At one point, he [Alex] told me he had gone AWOL and was back in Los Angeles, in a military prison, and needed more money to get out.""""I ended up giving him more than £100 000.""Jean is not alone and is one of a rising number of women to fall victim to this particular form of online dating fraud, where the scammer poses as a US soldier - they often say they're stationed at a US base in the UK, to inspire hope that a relationship is possible.The yarn spun by ""Alex"" - deserted by his wife; single father - is a common one. A desperate request for money is inevitable. The fraudsters behind the scam are often based in West Africa - Nigeria in particular - and it can prove very hard for authorities to track them down.They will sometimes use the names of real American soldiers - including those killed in action - and steal photos from military websites or the social media profiles of real soldiers to make their own dating profiles appear legitimate. This US soldier-in-distress online dating con has come to the attention of the United States Embassy in London. Scam on the riseSpeaking to the BBC, Consul General Derwood Staeben said people contacting the embassy to report dating fraud was now a daily occurrence:""When I arrived at my post two years ago, there were two or three a week. We've had more than 10 in the last five days.""""In the last 10 months, here at the embassy, we've logged around 450 phone calls and just shy of 2,000 emails.""This rise has also been recognised by the National Fraud Authority - earlier this year it reported a four-fold increase in the number of people reporting online dating fraud to the Action Fraud helpline. Rebecca - not her real name - is another victim who was sweet-talked by a fake soldier named ""Charlie"". She will not reveal how much money she has lost but says she is in a lot of debt as a result of the scam. She says she fears opening her mail, or answering her phone, as she doesn't know how to repay the money she borrowed to lend to Charlie. Like fellow victim Jean, she said the men posing as soldiers really know how to exploit the emotions of the women they hope to con. ""I was recently in hospital for an operation and on my way down to the theatre, he was texting me to say he was going to pray for me and he would soon be with me to take care of me.""""They go to great lengths to appear realistic. Sometimes you even get gifts - I was sent flowers, balloons and teddy bears, and would receive poems and emails every day.""They take weeks - in my case, months - to build up trust, asking you about your family and life, and making you feel loved.""Then they tell you a sob story about them being left alone with a child - they even send text messages and emails supposedly from their child.""Elaborate planOne of the common requests from the bogus soldiers is to ask the women they are conning to apply for leave on their behalf, so that they can come and visit them. This follows an elaborate set-up, where the women are asked to complete official-looking paperwork - and send a fee, which they are told will be refunded.This is what happened to Rebecca. She was even having daily telephone conversations with a man she believed was a US Army benefit officer, to help process Charlie's leave application - this was in fact another scammer posing as a US Army official.The US Embassy says that while specific procedures for requesting and granting leave differ among the branches of the US Armed Forces, the request and authorisation to take leave is between the individual service member and his immediate command - family, friends and third parties are never involved.Alarm bells began to ring for Rebecca when she was sent what was purported to be US Army documentation to convince her that Charlie was able to repay her the money she had been lending him. It claimed he had assets worth $1.4m (£890,000). ""No soldier has that kind of money,"" says Rebecca.""That's when I rang the US Army and they told me they hadn't heard of him.""Facebook campaignWhile researching this story, the 5 live Investigates team spoke to dozens of women ripped off in this way. The majority are too embarrassed to share their story publicly but Rebecca and Jean were keen to speak, to try to ensure other women did not suffer the same fate. Today Rebecca is involved in a Facebook campaign, titled 'Stop the US Army Dating Scam' in the hope that she can warn other women of this costly hoax. Since starting the campaign, she has been contacted by more than 240 other women who have also fallen victim to phoney soldiers through online dating sites. Not all of them have lost cash but many have bought laptops, mobile phones and cameras, which they sent to addresses where the ""soldiers"" said they had friends. The US Embassy says anyone who has been a target of dating fraud should report their case to their local police force. Rebecca reported her case but was told there was no chance of her ever getting her money back. However, in Jean's case, police did manage to trace some of the money she sent to accounts in Nigeria and California. They recovered just over £13,000 - small consolation when the total sum she sent was close to £100,000. A year on after being caught out, Jean is utterly distraught knowing she was conned and feels she has let her family down.""What hurts the most is that when my husband died of cancer, he put everything in order. He had arranged for money to be invested so I could draw an income each month and I could have a decent lifestyle. And I went and wasted all the money and that broke my heart.""""I have three teenage grandchildren. I like to help them out, give them pocket money. But of course I had to tell them about this and tell them that it meant I can't give them anything any more."" ""I'm close to my family and I feel I let them all down."" ""My son told me: 'How many times in life have you told us to be careful?' And now look what you did.""You can hear the full report on 5 live Investigates on Sunday, 26 September at 2100 BST on BBC Radio 5 live.

"The MSP behind plans to give terminally ill people the right to die in Scotland has dismissed claims the law could result in up to 1,000 deaths a year.  Margo MacDonald said the figure was nearer 55, based on the US state of Oregon, where such a law operates. Her comments came as a special parliament committee finished taking evidence on the End of Life Assistance Bill.The proposals will face their first parliamentary vote in November.It is not illegal to attempt suicide in Scotland, but helping someone take their own life could lead to prosecution.Ms MacDonald's bill would allow people whose lives become intolerable through a progressive degenerative condition, a trauma or terminal illness to seek a doctor's help in dying.It also proposes a series of safeguards which would prevent abuse of the legislation.Michael Matheson, an SNP member on the committee, said the bill was much closer to Dutch, rather than US legislation.""Using the very same methodology that you've used to calculate the figures, the number of people who may exercise their rights under this legislation, if enacted, is closer to 1,000 rather than 55,"" he said.Ms MacDonald, independent MSP for the Lothians, pointed to recent improvements in palliative care, responding: ""I don't think you can make that leap of judgment or estimate, if you like.""The MSP, who has Parkinson's disease, also played down concerns over the ""burden"" the law would place on GPs, adding: ""I believe that there is no difference between sitting beside someone as they self-inject or ingest and pressing the plunger.""She pointed out that no doctor would have to take part in assisted suicide under the bill if it was against their ""conscience or moral belief"".MSPs will decide the bill's fate in a ""free vote"", rather than along party lines, although it is unclear whether the legislation will make it past the first of its three voting stages.In England, the director of public prosecutions has indicated he was unlikely to take legal action against those who assist the suicide of friends or relatives who have a settled and informed wish to die.However, no such guidance has been given in Scotland.",Right-to-die MSP Margo MacDonald dismisses claims,Scotland,"Margo MacDonald dismisses claims a ""right-to-die"" law in Scotland could result in up to 1,000 deaths a year.",BBC News

"What happened to Rod Stewart the songwriter?The last original song the man behind global smash Maggie May released was the title track of 1998 album When We Were the New Boys. It was the only original on an album full of tracks written by other artists.Since then, Stewart has concentrated on album after album of his Great American Songbook series and other cover collections.""You could say we're addicted to it, really,"" he says in trademark raspy voice, made hoarser by a bout of flu.""You could go on, I could record another five - we'd never run out of songs.""All of those cover albums to date - beginning with 2002's first Great American Songbook - have gone platinum in the UK and the US.Stewart's fifth and final instalment of his lushly-orchestrated series features ""good cocktail hour, dinner party music"" including I Get A Kick Out Of You, I've Got You Under My Skin and Beyond The Sea.Diehard Rod fans will lap it up. But don't they also deserve to know why the 65-year-old - who wrote such hits as You Wear It Well, Hot Legs, Baby Jane and Every Beat Of My Heart - has dried up when it comes to penning his own hits?Stewart fires back a series of explanations.""There's many reasons, I don't feel the desire at the moment - I haven't met somebody I feel I can write with. ""It's difficult to get the new material played with us old-timers, it really is. ""I think we've had a fair crack of the whip, so we can't complain.

It went on to top the UK and US charts for five weeks each.""When it went to number one in Britain and America, that's when we all went out and got drunk,"" Stewart says.""The drinking went on for a long time and why not?""He says he remembers visiting his parents shortly afterwards: ""That was probably the most gratifying, more than any big cheque or new car or whatever, to know that not just my mum and dad but my whole family had stood by me.""They weren't the type to say 'get yourself a day job, it's not going to last', which is not what you want to hear when you're a musician.""But will the former mod, who is due to become a father for the eighth time next year, ever again celebrate a self-written hit?It's only when asked if he ever writes that things become clear.""No, never. It's always been hard work.""The nearest thing that this business I'm in comes to being a job is when I've had to write songs.""This is not an ageing rocker with a chronic case of writers' block.

"A priest in Canada has apologised after giving Holy Communion to a dog.Reverend Marguerite Rea of St Peter's Anglican Church, in Toronto, received complaints from Christians all over Canada after she fed communion bread to a German Shepherd cross named Trapper.Area Bishop Patrick Yu said the priest had contravened church policy with her ""strange and shocking"" actions.Ms Rea said it had been a ""simple church act of reaching out"" to a new congregation member and his pet.""If I have hurt, upset or embarrassed anyone, I apologise,"" she told her congregation on Sunday morning, the Toronto Star reports.The canine controversy began last month when four-year-old Trapper and his owner, Donald Keith, 56, attended the church in Toronto's downtown area for the first time.""The minister welcomed me and said come up and take communion, and Trapper came up with me and the minister gave him communion as well,"" Mr Keith told the Toronto Star.""I thought it was a nice way to welcome me into the church.

Francesca's father Harmen Rijks, 49, said he was told by Ryanair customer service when he bought the tickets that the valuable violin could be taken on board the flight as hand luggage.He said the air pressure and low temperature in the hold would have ruined the instrument, which belongs to the Manchester music school Chetham's, where Francesca is a pupil.He said: ""When we checked in, Francesca was carrying the violin on her back so they must have noticed it but they let us through. ""But when we got to the gates they refused to let us go.""They said we could pay extra to put the violin in the hold, but because of the temperature and air pressure difference, the wood can crack and completely ruin a violin. The insurance also becomes void,"" he said.""This was an absolute disgrace. Their policy appears to discriminate against violinists, the vast majority of whom simply can't afford to purchase an additional seat,"" he added.The Ryanair website says small musical instruments can be taken on board their flights but customers have to purchase an extra seat if they are larger than standard baggage.A spokesman for Ryanair said: ""Ryanair's website, booking confirmation page and the e-mailed itinerary which is sent to every passenger is very clear in relation to the carriage of musical instruments and states that smaller musical items, such as a guitar, violin or viola which exceed our cabin baggage dimensions may be carried in the cabin but only if an extra seat has been purchased to accommodate the instrument.  ""This policy, which must be accepted by every passenger before a booking can be made, ensures that such instruments, which can be expensive, remain with the passenger.

"The Lord Chief Justice has said he is astonished that six disputed general election ballot papers have not been set aside for the courts to scrutinise. Sinn Fein's Michelle Gildernew retained Fermanagh-South Tyrone by a majority of four votes, following three recounts. Defeated unionist unity candidate Rodney Connor claims to have two witnesses who saw six votes counted which should have been rejected. Sir Declan Morgan said he thought the disputed papers should have been found.Mr Connor is claiming there were breaches of the statutory rules and is seeking a scrutiny of the votes, a recount and a determination that Ms Gildernew was not duly elected.The victorious Sinn Fein candidate insists, however, that she was properly returned by the people of Fermanagh and South Tyrone as their MP.A total of 46,803 were cast, with a turnout of 68.9%. A barrister for the count's returning officer told the review hearing at the High Court in Belfast: ""For the first time there is a factual situation described in which it is alleged certain votes, wholly unidentifiable, ought to have been rejected."" Paul Maguire QC argued these were not going to be put before the court for any examination. Mr Connor's lawyer said there was a ""practical difficulty"" in the six votes being among 47,000 admitted in the count. Patrick Good said one witness, James Cooper, saw four votes which should have been rejected, while Mr Connor's election agent wife Liz had identified a further two similar votes. Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, sitting with Mr Justice Gillen, said: ""The court sees enormous difficulty if these votes are not identified."" He said that, if Mr Connor is right, the six disputed votes ""make all the difference"". ""Your evidence is likely to be that you have two witnesses who claim votes should have been rejected,"" he told the court. ""The deputy returning officer who examined them decided they shouldn't be rejected but should be admitted. ""The court is not going to be able to see the votes. ""I have to confess, for my own part, I'm astonished, even if it did require consideration of 47,000 votes, that some process wasn't put in place over the summer."" Sir Declan confirmed the three-day hearing was ready to proceed on Monday, and warned it would not be stopped for any discovery issues.

"Sports Minister Nelson McCausland has expressed his disappointment at the situation at the IFA.Last weekend, four members of its executive, including president Raymond Kennedy and vice-president David Martin resigned with immediate effect.Mr Kennedy will now remain on the IFA's executive board so it has a working quorum, but will offer his resignation at a council meeting in September.Mr McCausland described the events as ""sad"".""Over the course of the week I have been stopped by people in the street that I have been talking to and they have just shaken their heads, people are lost for words,"" he said.""If it wasn't so ridiculous, it would at times be funny, but it is not.""It is a sad situation.""Mr McCausland had already made it clear that substantial government funding for football would be put at risk if Mr Kennedy and Mr Martin remained in their jobs at the IFA.He said on Thursday that he was pleased the IFA had assured him that an independent review of its governance arrangement would take place, but was disappointed this was not already under way.He said he felt this could be completed within a ""matter of months"".""This is a structural issue it is not simply about two individuals, that's the symptom of a deeper problem,"" he added.""The best thing is to have an independent review carried out in a way that will ensure that I as the minister, sports people, football fans, teams, everyone has assurance and confidence in the organisation and we have governance that is fit for purpose.""The question is not if the IFA gets its house in order, the question is when the IFA gets its house in order.""The IFA confirmed earlier this week that it had received the resignations of Mr Kennedy, Mr Martin, honorary treasurer Neil Jardine and board member Jim Shaw. The IFA council will meet on 6 September to determine the process to be followed for the election of office bearers at the September council meeting. The IFA statement on Tuesday confirming Mr Kennedy would remain on the IFA board until next month was released after two days of frantic meetings involving the main players in the ongoing internal wranglings. The organisation has been in turmoil since Mr Kennedy was criticised in an independent report into the sacking of former chief executive Howard Wells. The upheaval comes at a time when government funding for the redevelopment of Windsor Park stadium is at risk. Mr McCausland said on Thursday that he was ""absolutely confident"" funding would be made available for the upgrading of sports stadia in Northern Ireland.""We are now entering the next comprehensive spending review, that money is down there in the comprehensive spending review, I believe the executive will approve that,"" he said.""There is widespread support right across the parties for good stadia for football, for rugby and for gaelic.""When we get that money through the comprehensive spending review, we will know exactly what the level of funding will be for a replacement stadium and then football can look foward at international level to a much brighter future.""The resignations of the quartet from the IFA executive board left the executive committee with just five remaining members - one short of the minimum number required for decisions to be taken. Representatives of Premiership clubs met on Monday and it was indicated that there was ""unanimous agreement"" that Mr Kennedy and Mr Martin should quit their positions ""as soon as possible"".

"The crisis in the euro area highlights two problems with a currency shared by states with their own taxing and spending powers. What happens if some of individual states fail to control their own finances? And what about a situation where their competitiveness diverges?The same questions arise, or could arise, with another large currency area, the United States. It has more individual units - 50 compared with the euro area's 16. That might make it even more unmanageable. But unlike in Europe, there is no talk of the currency union breaking apart. Why not? For one thing there is more discipline on the finances of the states. Nearly all have a legal or constitutional obligation to at least attempt to balance part of their budgets - though many can borrow for investment.  They do struggle sometimes, as California is now. It is certainly a political issue. But the shortfall is modest compared to the crisis facing some European states. The gap, which Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is trying to close, is $18bn (£12.4bn) for two years, about 0.5% of state income, its GDP. Then there is borrowing for investment which is also this year less than 1% of California's GDP.  For Greece, the total last year was 13.6%. So the US has a system of fiscal discipline - at state level that seems to be more effective than Europe's Stability and Growth Pact which tries, and has failed, to limit deficits to 3% of GDP. The US has another major advantage. The Federal budget has an important role in softening the impact of shocks that hit one state more than another. If one state is especially hit by economic events, its people pay less in federal taxes, and federal spending can be increased. Some of this happens automatically, especially on the tax side. And it can be augmented by deliberate policy decisions by the Federal government.  In Europe, the EU budget is too small for that effect to help very much. It is less than 1.5% of GDP. Public spending is dominated by the member states. In the US, Federal spending is about 15 times larger. Some European countries also have a problem with competitiveness. For a country with its own currency there is the option of allowing it to depreciate. But when you lose competitiveness against countries with the same currency it's no solution. That has happened in the Euro area. One measure of competitiveness is unit labour costs, which reflects changes in both workers pay and how much they produce.Between 2001 and 2008, according to OECD data, unit labour costs increased by more than 20% in Greece, Spain, Italy and Ireland. In Germany they fell slightly and the average for the Euro as a whole was a more moderate increase of 12%. In the absence of a depreciation option, the only way of restoring competitiveness is lower pay and other costs. It can happen but it is hard to achieve and can easily lead to the kind of strife now hitting Greece.Of course the US does have internal differences in competitiveness, but workers are more ready to move - the single language helps of course - and pay cuts aren't quite so hard for employers to impose. Differences do persist, but there are features of the country's labour market that act as a kind of shock absorber.  What the Euro crisis has underlined is the difficulty of a single currency in the absence of a closer political union and more flexible labour markets. It may be possible to fix those problems. But it will take years. ",What Europe can learn from the US,Business,"The crisis in the euro area has highlighted real problems with monetary union in which individual economies are very different.

"A Warwickshire exhibition includes an image of Yoko Ono and John Lennon which has not been seen in public before, a photographer says. The image, showing Lennon cuddling his new wife at a Top of the Pops rehearsal in 1970, was unveiled at Gallery 150 in Leamington Spa. It is part an exhibition by Bill Zygmant, who was a Fleet Street photographer in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. The exhibition will run until 10 September. Mr Zygmant, who is famous for taking images of The Beatles, said it was evident from photographing the couple that they had been devoted to each other. ""I was the only photographer at the Top of the Pops studios and I was very lucky to get the shot,"" he said. ""It was all quite rushed and I did not realise at the time how special it would be."" The photo was taken on 11 February, 1970, when Lennon was recording Instant Karma! (We all shine on) for transmission the next day. Mr Zygmant, of Rugby, said other pictures from the photography session had been published, but this one was among many exclusive photos he had found in his bag of negatives. He first took Lennon's picture in 1964 when he joked with the singer that he was earning more than him, with an income of £100 a week. Other unseen pictures at the Leamington show include a photo of Captain Sensible after he had released Happy Talk and a picture of Status Quo with all their roadies.

"Thousands of Greeks have protested in the centre of the capital, Athens, as part of a general strike against government austerity measures. Demonstrators converged on the parliament building before dispersing.The 24-hour strike has seen schools closed and ferry and train services across the country halted.It was called in response to government moves to cut public sector wages and increase taxes.The Labour Ministry was occupied by communist protesters and rally organisers had hoped up to 100,000 people would join protests on the street. There were fears of renewed violence after protests in the city two weeks ago led to the deaths of three people when a bank was fire-bombed.But the crowds marching through Athens were smaller than those which took part in that general strike, reports the BBC's Malcolm Brabant from the Greek capital.Lines of riot police stood guard at vulnerable points near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier to deter protesters from trying to storm the parliament building. Many Greeks are angered by the spending cuts and tax and pension-age rises planned in return for a 110bn-euro (£95bn) bail-out from the EU and IMF. The measures aim to achieve billions of euros in budget cuts over three years, with the goal of cutting Greece's public deficit to less than 3% of GDP by 2014. It currently stands at 13.6%. The strike officially began at midnight on Wednesday local time.Train services, shipping and domestic flights were severely disrupted.The strike was also expected to force the closure of government buildings, schools and banks, and to reduce hospitals to emergency staff later in the day.The country's main civil service and public sector unions say they represent some 2.5 million workers. ""People are bleeding financially but they will participate in the strike,"" Ilias Vrettakos, a senior member of the ADEDY union, was quoted as saying by Reuters.However, Greek air traffic controllers are not taking part in the industrial action. They have decided to continue working because travellers have faced too much disruption recently from the Icelandic volcano and also because of concerns about the impact of the strike on tourism, says our correspondent.He adds that journalists have also decided to postpone their industrial action, because one of the most essential components of this rolling campaign is publicity. The strike on 5 May in Athens generated some of the worst violence in decades.The death of three bank workers, who suffocated when their office was fire-bombed, has forced many people to question the way protests have been mounted, our correspondent says.He adds that the demonstrations during this latest strike will be a barometer of the mood of the nation.",Greece brought to standstill by anti-austerity strike,Europe,Thousands of Greeks protest in the centre of Athens as part of a general strike against government austerity measures.,BBC News

"Word cloud based on prepared text. Full-size image on Wordle.netEd Miliband has delivered his first speech as Labour leader to the party conference in Manchester. Here is the full text.Conference, I stand here today ready to lead: a new generation now leading Labour.Be in no doubt.The new generation of Labour is different. Different attitudes, different ideas, different ways of doing politics.Today I want to tell you who I am, what I believe and how we are going to do the most important thing we have to do - win back the trust of the country. We all of us share a deep conviction which brought us into this party and into this hall. But each of us has our own individual story. And I want to tell you about mine.In 1940, my grandfather, with my Dad, climbed onto one of the last boats out of Belgium. They had to make a heart breaking decision - to leave behind my grandmother and my father's sister. They spent the war in hiding, in a village sheltered by a brave local farmer. Month after month, year upon year, they lived in fear of the knock at the door.At the same time, on the other side of Europe, my mother, aged five, had seen Hitler's army march into Poland.She spent the war on the run sheltering in a convent and then with a Catholic family that took her in. Her sister, her mother and her.My love for this country comes from this story. Two young people fled the darkness that had engulfed the Jews across Europe and in Britain they found the light of liberty. They arrived with nothing. This country gave them everything. It gave them life and the things that make life worth living: hope, friendship, opportunity and family.And they took hope and opportunity. They worked hard; they got on. My Dad learnt English, paid his way moving furniture during the day, and studying at night at technical college. He joined the Navy to fight for our country and afterwards he wanted to go to university. He did. My Mum built a life here after the war, for all of us. I know nobody more generous, nobody more kind, nobody more loving and nobody more relieved that this is contest is over, than my Mum.The gift my parents gave to me and David are the things I want for every child in this country. A secure and loving home. Encouragement and the aspiration to succeed.In those ways my family was just like every other. But in some ways it was different. I suppose not everyone has a dad who wrote a book saying he didn't believe in the Parliamentary road to socialism. But you know, it wasn't a cold house. It was warm, full of the spirit of argument and conviction, the conviction that leads me to stand before you today, the conviction that people of courage and principle can make a huge difference to their world. What my parents learnt in fear, they passed on to us in an environment of comfort and security. And there was one more lesson that I learnt. We do not have to accept the world as we find it. And we have a responsibility to leave our world a better place and never walk by on the other side of injustice. Freedom and opportunity are precious gifts and the purpose of our politics is to expand them, for all our people. That faith is not something I chose. It's not something I learned from books, even from my Dad's books. It was something I was born into.And that is why David and I have devoted our lives to politics. And it is why I will commit to you here and now. My beliefs will run through everything I do. My beliefs, my values are my anchor and when people try to drag me, as I know they w ill, it is to that sense of right and wrong, that sense of who I am and what I believe, to which I will always hold. Conference, I am so honoured that you chose me to lead your party and I know you share those values. And I am proud that every day, day in and day out, in every village, and every town and city in the land, you work to put those values into practice. Conference, can I thank you for the heroic work you did at the election.The reason we denied the Conservative Party a majority was because of the incredible work of Labour and trade union members the length and breadth of our country.From Birmingham Edgbaston to Westminster North and from Edinburgh South to the Vale of Clwyd, it was your dedication, your energy and your determination to fight for the communities you love that beat the Ashcroft millions. And let me thank everyone, not just Labour Party members, but thousands of ordinary members of the public who drove the BNP out of Barking and Dagenham.But let's face facts.We had a bad result.We had a very bad result.And we are out of government.And let me tell you, there is nothing good about opposition.Every day out of power, another day when this coalition can wreak damage on our communities, another day when we cannot change our country for the better.And let us resolve today that this will be a one-term government. That is the purpose of my leadership of this party.But to achieve that we must go on our own journey.And that is why the most important word in politics for us is humility.We need to learn some painful truths about where we went wrong and how we lost touch. We must not blame the electorate for ending up with a government we don't like, we should blame ourselves. We have to understand why people felt they couldn't support us. We have to show we understand the problems people face today. This will require strong leadership. It won't always be easy. You might not always like what I have to say. But you've elected me leader and lead I will.This country faces some tough choices. And so do we. And we need to change.You remember. We began as restless and radical. Remember the spirit of 1997, but by the end of our time in office we had lost our way. The most important lesson of New Labour is this: Every time we made progress we did it by challenging the conventional wisdom. Think of how we took on the idea that there was a public ownership solution to every problem our society faced. We changed Clause 4. We were right to do so.Think of how we emphasised being tough on crime was as important as being tough on the causes of crime. We were right to do so.Think of how we challenged the impression that we taxed for its own sake and that we were hostile to business. We were right to change.And think of how we challenged the idea of a male dominated Parliament with All-Women shortlists and made the cause of gender equality central to our government. We were right to do so. And the reason Tony and Gordon took on conventional wisdom in our party was so they could change the country.We forget too easily what a radical challenge their ideas were to established ways of thinking about Britain and how they reshaped the centre-ground of politics.They were reforming, restless and radical.The old way of thinking said that economic efficiency would always come at the price of social justice.With the minimum wage, tax credits, the New Deal, they showed that was wrong. I am proud that our government lifted hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty, hundreds of thousands of pensioners out of poverty, proud that we created the highest levels of employment in Britain's history.The old way of thinking said that public services would always be second-class. But we defied the conventional wisdom.I come from a generation that suffered school lessons in portacabins and crumbling hospitals. I tell you one thing, for the eighteen years they were in power the Tories did nothing to fix the roof when the sun was shining. Our legacy is a generation for whom newly built schools and modernised hospitals are an everyday fact of life. I am proud of the fact that because of what we did, yes we did save the National Health Service in this country.The old way of thinking said that you couldn't change attitudes towards gay men and lesbians.Let me tell you that last month I was privileged to be in this great city, at Pride, to see not just thousands of people marching but thousands of people lining the street in support.We should be proud that our commitment to equality means we have couples forming civil partnerships across the country and celebrating with t heir family and friends.The old thinking told us that for 300 years, the choice was either the break up of the United Kingdom or Scotland and Wales run from London.We should be proud that Labour established the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly. And we should make sure that after next May's elections we re-elect Carwyn Jones as the First Minister in Wales and we elect Iain Gray as the new First Minister in Scotland.And I am so so proud that, against all the odds, we helped deliver peace in Northern Ireland. And it will be one of Tony Blair's great legacies to this country and we owe our gratitude to him.The old thinking told us that the challenges of the world were too big and our country too small to make a difference.But thanks to our leadership around the world, development spending is now heading towards our goal, forty million more children are going to school each day, and two hundred million are protected from malaria. And that would never have happened without the leadership of Gordon Brown as Chancellor and then as Prime Minister.Tony and Gordon had the courage to take on established attitudes and institutions in Britain.It is that courage that made us such a successful political force.But our journey must also understand where it went wrong. I tell you, I believe that Britain is fairer and stronger than it was 13 years ago.But we have to ask, how did a party with such a record lose five million votes between 1997 and 2010?It didn't happen by accident.The hard truth for all of us in this hall is that a party that started out taking on old thinking became the prisoner of its own certainties.The world was changing all around us - from global finance to immigration to terrorism - New Labour, a political force founded on its ability to adapt and change lost its ability to do so.The reason was that we too often bought old, established ways of thinking and over time we just looked more and more like a new establishment.Let me say to the country:You saw the worst financial crisis in a generation, and I understand your anger that Labour hadn't changed the old ways in the City of deregulation. You wanted your concerns about the impact of immigration on communities to be heard, and I understand your frustration that we didn't seem to be on your side.And when you wanted to make it possible for your kids to get on in life, I understand why you felt that we were stuck in old thinking about higher and higher levels of personal debt, including tuition fees.You saw jobs disappear and economic security undermined, I understand your anger at a Labour government that claimed it could end boom and bust.And I understand also that the promise of new politics of 1997 came to look incredibly hollow after the scandal of MPs' expenses. And we came to look like a new establishment in the company we kept, the style of our politics and our remoteness from people.I stand before you, clear in my task: to once again make Labour a force that takes on established thinking, doesn't succumb to it, speaks for the majority and shapes the centre ground of politics.And I tell you this: if we are not this party, nobody will be.This new generation that leads our party is humble about our past and idealistic about our future. It is a generation that will always stand up for the mainstream majority.It is a generation that will fight for the centre ground, not allow it to be dominated or defined by our opponents. And it is a generation which thirsts for change.This week we embark on the journey back to power.It will be a long journey involving hard thinking for our party.We do not start that journey by claiming we know all the answers now. We do so by setting a direction of change.Let me tell you what kind of country I want us to build together:This generation wants to change our economy so that it works better for working people and doesn't just serve the needs of the few at the top.This generation wants to change our society so that it values community and family, not just work, because we understand there is more to life than the bottom line.This generation wants to change the way government works because it understands the power of the state to change lives but also how frustrating it can be if not reformed. This generation wants to change our foreign policy so that it's always based on values, not just alliances. And this generation knows very profoundly that to change Britain we need a new politics.Above all, I lead a new generation not bound by the fear or the ghosts of the past. As we emerge from the global economic crisis, we face a choice: we can return to business as usual or we can challenge old thinking to build a new economy.Let me say, I believe strongly that we need to reduce the deficit. There will be cuts, and there would have been if we had been in government. Some of them will be painful, and would have been if we were in government. I won't oppose every cut the coalition proposes.There will be some things the coalition does that we won't like as a party but we will have to support. And come the next election there will be some things they have done that I'll want to reverse but will not be able to. I say this because the fiscal credibility we earned before 1997 was hard won and we must win it back by the time of the next general election.I am serious about reducing our deficit.But I am also serious about doing it in a way that learns the basic lessons of economics, fairness and history.Economics teaches us that at a time of recession governments run up deficits. We were too exposed to financial services as an economy so the impact of the crash on the public finances was deeper on us than on others.We should take responsibility for not building a more resilient economy.But what we should not do as a country is make a bad situation worse by embarking on deficit reduction at a pace and in a way that endangers our recovery. The starting point for a responsible plan is to halve the deficit over four years, but growth is our priority and we must remain vigilant against a downturn. You see, it's obvious really, when you cancel thousands of new school buildings at a stroke, it isn't just bad for our kids, it's bad for construction companies at a time when their order books are empty.It's not responsible, it's irresponsible.When you deprive Sheffield Forgemasters of a loan, a loan from which government would be paid back, you deprive Britain of the ability to lead the world in new technology. It's not responsible, it's irresponsible. And we should say so.And when you reduce your economic policy simply to deficit reduction alone, you leave Britain without a plan for growth, which is what this government has done. No plan for growth means no credible plan for deficit reduction.And nor should we reduce the deficit without learning the basic lessons of fairness.We must protect those on middle and low incomes. They did nothing to cause the crisis but are suffering the consequences.I say the people who caused the crisis and can afford to do more should do more: with a higher bank levy allowing us to do more to protect the services and entitlements on which families depend.And we should learn the basic lessons of history.After 1945, we had the biggest debt we have ever had.That generation did cut the deficit but they had a bigger vision: for our economy and a good society.True patriotism is about reducing the debt burden we pass on to our kids.But Mr Cameron, true patriotism is also about building an economy and a society fit for our kids to live in.Mr Cameron, you were the optimist once but now all you offer is a miserable, pessimistic view of what Britain can achieve. And you hide behind the deficit to justify it. We won't let you get away with it.But I have a different ambition, to emerge from the global economic crisis tackling the deficit, but also learning the much deeper lessons that this generation must learn. It is a huge challenge to change our economy for the future and the same old thinking will lead to the same old results: an economy too dependent on financial services, too many people stuck in low pay and growing inequality.We need a plan for change. A plan to reform the banks, invest in the industries of the future and support the small businesses and entrepreneurs who are the lifeblood of this economy.The new generation in the party understands the fundamental New Labour lesson that we must build prosperity as well as redistributing it. And it also knows that there are huge vested interests and huge barriers to the wealth creators in this country, particularly small businesses and the self-employed. These must be tackled. I tell you this, I am determined to make Labour the party of enterprise and small business again. And I want British businesses, large and small, to be able to make the most of the advantages of globalisation. New Labour was right to be enthusiastic about the opportunities that come in a more connected world: the movement of goods and services, the chance to travel, the new markets for our companies. But this new generation recognises that we did not do enough to address concerns about globalisation, including migration.All of us heard it on the doorsteps about immigration. Like the man I met in my constituency who told me he had seen his mates' wages driven down by the consequences of migration.If we don't understand why he would feel angry - and it wasn't about prejudice - then we are failing to serve those who we are in politics to represent.I am the son of immigrants. I believe that Britain has benefited economically, culturally, socially from those who came to this country. I don't believe either that we can turn back the clock on free movement of labour in Europe. But we should never have pretended it would not have consequences. Consequences we should have dealt with.We have to challenge the old thinking that flexible labour markets are always the answer. Employers should not be allowed to exploit migrant labour in order to undercut wages. And if we have free movement of labour across Europe we need proper labour standards in our economy, including real protection for agency workers.And, as every democratic country recognises, it is vital that workers have a voice that speaks for them. I remember during this campaign I met some school dinner ladies. They had to buy their own uniforms, their shift patterns were being changed at a moment's notice, frankly conference they were being exploited.So they looked to their union to help them. They weren't interested in going on strike, they loved the kids the worked with, they loved their schools. But they wanted someone to help them get basic standards of decency and fairness. Responsible trade unions are part of a civilised society, every democratic country recognises that.But all of us in this movement bear a heavy responsibility. We want to win an argument about the danger this coalition government poses to our economy and our society. To do so we must understand the lessons of our own history too. We need to win the public to our cause and what we must avoid at all costs is alienating them and adding to the book of historic union failures.That is why I have no truck, and you should have no truck, with overblown rhetoric about waves of irresponsible strikes.The public won't support them. I won't support them. And you shouldn't support them either.But it is not just from trade unions that I want to see responsibility. This new generation demands responsibility from business too.During this campaign, I have met some extraordinary people doing amazing service for our country.I remember a care worker I met in Durham.She worked hard and with dedication, looking after our mums, dads and grandparents when they couldn't look after themselves anymore.She is doing one of the most important jobs in our society, and if it was my mum or dad, I would want anyone who cared for them to be paid a decent wage.But she was barely paid the minimum wage - and barely a few pence extra for higher skills.She told me that she thought a fair wage would be £7 an hour because, after all, she would get that for stacking shelves at the local supermarket.I believe in responsibility in every part of our society.That's why I believe in not just a minimum wage but the foundation of our economy in the future must be a living wage too.And we need a tax system for business that rewards responsibility:To pay a living wage;To provide high quality apprenticeships;And family-friendly employment.And we need responsibility at the top of society too. The gap between rich and poor does matter. It doesn't just harm the poor it harms us all.What does it say about the values of our society, what have we become, that a banker can earn in a day what the care worker earns in a year? It's wrong, conference.I say: responsibility in this country shouldn't just be about what you can get away with.And that applies to every chief executive of every major company in this country.And, just as businesses have responsibility to ensure fair pay, so those who can work have a responsibility to do so.This is one of the hardest issues for our party because all of us know in our communities people who are in genuine need and who worry about the impact of new medical tests, or changes to rules on them.At the same time, let's be honest, we also know there are those for whom the benefits system has become a trap.That is not in their interests or the interests of us a society and we are right when we say it must be challenged.Reforming our benefits system is not about stereotyping everybody out of work, it's about transforming their lives.Real help matched with real responsibility. That is why on welfare, I will look closely at whatever the government comes forward with: not arbitrary cuts to benefits but a genuine plan to make sure that those in need are protected and that those who can work have the help they need to ensure they do so. Work is a central part of life. But it is not all that matters.We all care about making a living, but we don't just care about that.Here is our generation's paradox: the biggest ever consumers of goods and services, but a generation that yearns for the things that business cannot provide.Strong families.Time with your children. Green spaces.Community lifeLove and compassion.New Labour embraced markets in our economy and was right to do so.But let's be honest, we became naive about them.We must never again give the impression that we know the price of everything and the value of nothing.We must be on the side of communities who want to save their local post office, not be the people trying to close it.We must be on the side of people trying to protect their high street from looking like every other high street, not the people who say that's just the forces of progress.And we must be on the side of those who are dismayed by the undermining of the local pub with cut-price alcohol from supermarkets.We must shed old thinking and stand up for those who believe there is more to life than the bottom line.We stand for these things not because we are social conservatives but because we believe in community, belonging and solidarity.And I tell you this: the good life is about the things we do in our community and the time we spend with family. I feel this so deeply since the birth of my son sixteen months ago.As we rebuild our economy, we must think how we protect families up and down this country.Families can't do the best job if they are stressed out, working 60 or 70 hours a week, can't be there when the kids get home, doing two or three jobs.We've got to change our culture on working time, not just for the good of families, but because it is through family that we learn right from wrong, develop ambitions for ourselves, and show kindness and respect for others.When I look at some of the challenges we face as a country - from gangs to teenage pregnancy - it is only a government that stands up for families that are trying their best to bring up their kids that can offer answers. So as we rebuild our economy we must think about how we protect and nourish the things that matter to families and to family life.This new generation must also challenge the way we think about the state and what it can achieve.I believe profoundly that government plays a fantastically important role in creating the good society. But our new generation also knows that government can itself become just such a vested interest. That unless reformed, unless accountable, unless responsive, government can impede the good society. Our new generation, hungry for change, is unwilling to see that happen.Like millions of people around the country, I went to my local comprehensive. I know the value of a good school, a good teacher. And I know there are many parents frustrated, with a school that doesn't suit your child or live up to your hopes.There are amazing secondary schools in my constituency and amazing teachers and head teachers. But one of them was consistently failing its pupils. And it pained me as an MP to walk into that school knowing those kids were being consistently let down. Now that school has been taken over, the kids life chances transformed.That is what good public service reform is all about.My generation recognises too that government can itself become a vested interest when it comes to civil liberties. I believe in a society where individual freedom and liberty matter and should never be given away lightly.The first job of government is the protection of its citizens. As prime minister I would never forget that.And that means working with all the legitimate means at our disposal to disrupt and destroy terrorist networks. But we must always remember that British liberties were hard fought and hard won over hundreds of years.We should always take the greatest care in protecting them.And too often we seemed casual about them.Like the idea of locking someone away for 90 days - nearly three months in prison - without charging them with a crime.Or the broad use of anti-terrorism measures for purposes for which they were not intended. They just undermined the good things we did like CCTV and DNA testing.Protecting the public involves protecting all their freedoms.I won't let the Tories or the Liberals take ownership of the British tradition of liberty. I want our party to reclaim that tradition.So too in our foreign policy the new generation must challenge old thinking. We are the generation that came of age at the end of the Cold War.The generation that was taught that the end of history had arrived and then saw 9/11 shatter that illusion.And we are the generation that recognises that we belong to a global community: we can't insulate ourselves from the world's problems.For that reason, right now this country has troops engaged in Afghanistan. They represent the very best of our country. They and their families are making enormous sacrifices on our behalf and we should today acknowledge their service and their sacrifice.Our troops are there to stabilise the country and enable a political settlement to be reached, as David said yesterday, so that Afghanistan can be stable and we can be safe.I will work in a bi-partisan way with the government to both support our mission and ensure Afghanistan is not a war without end.But just as I support the mission in Afghanistan as a necessary response to terrorism, I've got to be honest with you about the lessons of Iraq.Iraq was an issue that divided our party and our country. Many sincerely believed that the world faced a real threat. I criticise nobody faced with making the toughest of decisions and I honour our troops who fought and died there.But I do believe that we were wrong. Wrong to take Britain to war and we need to be honest about that. Wrong because that war was not a last resort, because we did not build sufficient alliances and because we undermined the United Nations.America has drawn a line under Iraq and so must we. Our alliance with America is incredibly important to us but we must always remember that our values must shape the alliances that we form and any military action that we take.So many of the world's problems need functioning international institutions. The days in which any country could achieve their goals on their own are over. There can be no solution to the conflicts of the Middle East without international support, providing pressure where it is needed, and pressure where it is right to do so.And let me say this, as Israel ends the moratorium on settlement building, I will always defend the right of Israel to exist in peace and security. But Israel must accept and recognise in its actions the Palestinian right to statehood. That is why the attack on the Gaza flotilla was so wrong. And that is why the Gaza blockade must be lifted and we must strain every sinew to work to make that happen.The government must step up and work with our partners in Europe and around the world to help bring a just and lasting peace to the Middle East.But to achieve all these things - a different economy, a different society and reform of the state, changes in our foreign policy  - we must change our politics too. Let's be honest, politics isn't working.People have lost faith in politicians and politics.And trust is gone.Politics is basically broken.Its practice, its reputation and its institutions.I'm in it and even I sometimes find it depressing.This generation has a chance  and a huge responsibility to change our politics. We must seize it and meet the challenge.So we need to reform our House of Commons and I support changing our voting system and will vote yes in the referendum on AV. Yes, we need to finally elect the House of Lords after talking about it for a hundred years. Yes, we need more decisions to be made locally, with local democracy free of the constraints we have placed on it in the past and free of an attitude which has looked down its nose at the work that local government does.And I want to congratulate all our local councillors and tell you: I will be shoulder to shoulder with you at next May's local elections, which must mean victory for Labour up and down this country.And the following year, we will be proud not only of the Olympics in London, but proud too to see them presided over by the next mayor of London, Ken Livingstone.And let me also congratulate Oona King on the campaign that she fought for the London election. Let's be honest, changing our institutions won't be enough to restore trust on its own.Look, in the end, it's politicians who have to change. This generation must reject the old ways of doing politics. And must speak to the issues our generation knows it must confront.The focus groups will tell you that there's no votes in green issues.Maybe not.But taking the difficult steps to protect our planet for future generations is the greatest challenge our generation faces.When I think about my son, in 20 years time he will be asking me whether I was part of the last generation not to get climate change or the first generation to get it.And climate change, just like the aging society, can't be tackled by the politics we have.They don't lend them selves to the politics of now: instant results, instant votes, instant popularity, X-factor politics.So we can't be imprisoned by the focus groups.Politics has to be about leadership or it is about nothing.I also know something else. Wisdom is not the preserve of any one party. Some of the political figures in history who I admire most are Keynes, Lloyd George, Beveridge, who were not members of the Labour Party.Frankly, the political establishment too often conducts debate in a way that insults the intelligence of the public.We must change this for the good of the country.I will be a responsible Leader of the Opposition.What does that mean?When I disagree with the government, as on the deficit, I will say so loud and clear and I will take the argument to them.But when Ken Clarke says we need to look at short sentences in prison because of high re-offending rates, I'm not going to say he's soft on crime.When Theresa May says we should review stop and search laws to prevent excessive use of state power, I'm not going to say she is soft on terrorism.I tell you this conference, our generation must find a new way of conducting politics.And that brings me to some of the names I've been called...Wallace out of Wallace and Gromit... I gather some people can see the resemblance.Forrest Gump... Not so much, I think.And what about Red Ed?Come off it.Let's start to have a grown-up debate in this country about who we are and where we want to go and what kind of country we want to build.A few days ago our contest came to an end and now the real contest has begun.I relish the chance to take on David Cameron. We may be of a similar age, but in my values and ideals I am of a different and new generation. The new generation is not simply defined by age, but by attitudes and ideals.And there is a defining difference between us and David Cameron - and that is optimism.We are the heirs to an extraordinary tradition, to great leaders who were above all the optimists of history.The optimism of 1945 which built the National Health Service and the welfare state.The optimism of Harold Wilson and the white heat of technology and the great social reforms of that government.The optimism of Tony and Gordon who took on the established thinking and reshaped our country.We are the optimists in politics today.So, let's be humble about our past. Let's understand the need to change. Let's inspire people with our vision of the good society.Let the message go out, a new generation has taken charge of Labour. Optimistic about our country. Optimistic about our world. Optimistic about the power of politics.

"A chance glance at an advertisement in a job centre in the Czech Republic sent artist Tibor Cervenak on a journey that would change his life.He answered the call for cleaners  in October 2004 when his country joined the European Union and he could work abroad.He ended up in Belfast on 12-hour shifts with a cleaning company. From there, he drove taxis, doing ""crazy hours"" across the city.But he had his dream. He was always painting pictures in his head.And when this abstract artist got a chance to exhibit his work, he sold the lot - all 25 paintings - in 10 days and forged a name for himself that helped put the taxi keys at the back of the shelf.Now, Tibor Cervenak is about to open a studio on Belfast's Lisburn Road and next year, he will be travelling to New York to fulfil a lifelong ambition to exhibit there.""I was among the first group to come to Belfast after my country joined the EU,"" said Tibor.""I found an ad from a cleaning company and I saw the opportunity.""""When I first arrived, it was very difficult.

"For many Americans, the young Ms Clinton who married her long-time beau Marc Mezvinsky on Saturday is in no need of her famous surname. She's just Chelsea.To her doting father, she's always been the centre of the universe. She ordered him to lose 15 pounds (7kg) before walking her down the aisle, and he unquestioningly complied. Before the event, the former president told another first daughter, Jenna Bush, that he would be both proud and wistful at the wedding, thinking about the day Chelsea was born and her first day of school.""I just hope I can keep it together,"" he said. For the equally adoring MOTB - that's Mother of The Bride, in case you didn't realise, and it's the acronym the Secretary of State has adopted - dress fittings and cake tastings have taken priority on a calendar that included meetings on Mid-East peace. But to the American public, Chelsea is the girl that grew up before their eyes, and they want a piece of the action. Ever since she appeared on the White House steps in 1993 as a typically gawky 12-year-old, Americans have eagerly dissected every small tidbit that managed to slip through her parentally constructed media shield.  Whether she likes it or not, the publicity-shy only child is a household name. Carl Anthony, an author and historian at the National First Ladies Library, says that Americans have been interested in Chelsea's wedding because she is part of the national narrative. ""It's a reflection of ourselves I think. It's this sense of a public event and these public people that we have sense of familiarity with,"" Mr Anthony says.""In Europe with its history of royal families, you've always had this. You've had national stories or national narratives."" For Americans, the Clintons fulfil that role.A wedding is a turning point in a universally recognised life narrative, which is why Chelsea's nuptials have garnered more attention than her graduations from Stanford and Oxford or her post 9/11 essay in Talk magazine. Chelsea's wedding has generated more interest than, for example, Jenna Bush's wedding in 2008, because she became part of the country's history at such a young age.Moreover, the Clintons are icons of a different, seemingly more youthful time in America's history - a pre 9/11 era when the country wasn't weighed down with wars, bulging deficits and billowing oil leaks. Chelsea is a reminder of that time, and people feel invested in the life of that young girl who held her parents hands through their darkest personal days. But, as Mr Anthony points out, despite her familiarity, people don't really know her. ""It's been 10 years since the Clintons left the White House and she's not in any way chosen or indicated a preference for a high-visibility public role. She's a grad school student,"" he told the BBC. ""It's not about her, it's about her parents.""And therein lies the problem with Chelsea's desire for nuptial privacy. The Clintons and their personal lives have long been magnets for the media, and despite their efforts, details of the wedding set the blogosphere alight.The 400 invitees were hosted at an estate in the Hudson River town of Rhinebeck, New York. Rumours have abounded that the cost of the wedding was between $3m and $5m (£1.9m - £3.2m).Aerial photographs which showed a large marquee being erected on the property of the Astor Courts Estate  made their way onto gossip blogs.That of course raised the inevitable question: where would guests relieve themselves? Apparently in classy porcelain portaloos, which cost around $15,000 to rent. One New York website called the loos ""nicer than your apartment"". For months, style watchers presumed that Chelsea would wear one of her mother's favourite designers, Oscar de la Renta. But this week she was snapped entering a Vera Wang store in Manhattan, attempting to hide her face under an oversized floppy hat - and she wore a strapless white gown by the designer on the day.The airspace over Rhinebeck was declared a ""no-fly zone"" on the afternoon of the wedding, further hampering the pesky paparazzi's ability to get that coveted shot.But mostly, the wedding details were overshadowed by debates over the guest list - specifically which of Bill and Hillary's celebrity pals would make the cut.President Obama ended speculation that he would attend by telling the ladies of US talk show The View that he didn't receive an invitation.Famous friends like Oprah Winfrey or Barbra Streisand were reported to be among those attending, but the Clintons had carefully clarified that each of the 400 guests must have a personal connection to the bride and groom.In typical Washington fashion, that sensible decree did not prevent griping from political contacts hoping that campaign generosity also buys a ticket to the A-list. ""I'm good enough to borrow a plane from, but not good enough to be invited to the wedding?"" an anonymous political donor grumbled to the New York Times. It's a quintessentially Washington mindset that conflates social and political power, access to which can often be bought.That's a world that Chelsea has rejected. The politics of her wedding are the politics of any wedding writ large.In the run-up, Chelsea had to grapple with questions that most brides do: how many people does the bride's family get to invite? What about the groom? How do I choose bridesmaids without causing hurt feelings? How big a secret do I keep the dress? But when your parents are Bill and Hillary Clinton those questions take on a new level of meaning. Chelsea didn't have a choice about that, or how many details of the wedding leaked. But these days, one thing she has control over is what people know about her.""What we perceive as secrecy about the wedding is really just privacy,"" Mr Anthony says. ""We forget that we don't know Chelsea. We think we do, but we don't.""",America's royal wedding,US & Canada,"Chelsea Clinton has spent a decade avoiding the media, but that hasn't stopped the American public clamouring for details of her wedding.",BBC News

"London universities are under pressure from students and community groups to support a campaign to pay cleaners a ""living wage"".Six universities in the capital now back a living wage of £7.60 per hour.King's College is set for talks with campaigners next week - while University College London says it has ""no plans"" to adopt the living wage.Students say the gap between high-paid university bosses and low-paid cleaners is ""shocking"".A cleaner on the minimum wage of £5.80, working 40-hours a week, 52 weeks a year, would have to work more than 33 years to earn the annual pay package of the provost of University College London.The University of London Union and London Citizens are campaigning for the living wage of £7.60 per hour to be paid to cleaners in universities in the capital.They say that the living wage is the threshold that is needed to survive in an expensive city such as London - and is higher than the legal minimum.It has been adopted by the London School of Economics, Birkbeck, the School of Oriental and African Studies, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Queen Mary.Goldsmiths says it is introducing the living wage when it renews its cleaning contract.King's College says it is about to hold an ""initial meeting"" with the students and representatives of London Citizens.But University College London says it has ""no plans to join the London Living Wage Campaign"".It says it pays its own directly-employed staff above the living wage, but this does not apply to cleaners who are hired through another company.""UCL considers itself a fair employer and benchmarks its rates of pay and conditions of employment against competitor organisations, in relation to which they are attractive,"" says the university.The university's president and provost, Malcolm Grant, is among the best paid university leaders in the UK.UCL says he was paid £303,492 in 2008-09 - with pension and benefits the total was £404,742.Students have contrasted the high levels of pay for the senior staff in universities with a reluctance to pay more for low-paid staff.A report earlier this year found that 19 university heads were earning more than £300,000.""For publicly-funded organisations there is an additional responsibility to have some kind of conscience,"" says ULU's vice president, Mazdak Alizadeh.""There is a clear parallel between high pay at the top and low pay at the bottom.""Those at the bottom should have enough to get by and not to have to live and work in poverty,"" he said.Describing the pay gap as ""shocking"", he said: ""It can't be justified to pay so much at the top when people who work for you are struggling to feed their families.""The living wage campaigners say that low pay condemns workers to a grinding life of poverty, many having to do two or three jobs, with limited time to see their own families.An election event organised by the Citizens UK community group - and promoters of the living wage - was addressed on Monday by leaders of the three biggest political parties.They heard the testimony of 14-year-old Tiari Sanchez who described the difficulties of a family trying to survive on her mother's income as a cleaner.She broke down in tears and was comforted by Labour leader Gordon Brown as she described the lack of money for the basics of food and travel.Her mother, who worked as a cleaner at the Treasury, had to leave home at 3.30am because she could not afford to travel there by tube.""If they were paying a living wage, my mum could afford the tube and I would see her for three hours more every day,"" she told the meeting.",Universities under pressure to pay living wage,Education & Family,"London universities are under pressure to support a campaign to pay their cleaners a ""living wage"".",BBC News
"Static and crackle, squawk boxes and coarse tones were the soundtrack to dealings in currencies and government bonds. But which way to trade? For weeks, the traders here have been betting on a Conservative victory. But the movements on the screens - tentative and nervous - initially mirrored the voters' lack of direction.Investors hate uncertainty, and these people are worried that a hung parliament will mean a government unwilling to make tough choices and upset an electorate that barely wanted it.Mainly, they fear that a weak government will be unable to force through measures to reduce the UK's high borrowing levels.As the morning wore on, traders took the view that such an outcome was likely. The interest rate that their market charges for UK government bonds - gilts - went up, while the lack of confidence took the pound down to a one-year low against the dollar.Piling on the pressure, the guidance from elsewhere for Friday's business was shaky in the extreme. Seismic downwards movements on the US markets -  virtually unseen in living memory - gave no strong lead to follow. Many think the 9% plunge the Dow Jones reached in Thursday's session was a slip of the finger, rather than a sign the market had glimpsed the apocalypse.And underpinning it all, as usual, was the theme of Greek debt woes and the knock-on fear of a euro break-up.European leaders are trying to agree the final details of of a 110bn-euro ($139bn; £86bn) loan package to Greece.On Friday, the cost of Greek and Portuguese government debt continued to rise, suggesting that investors remain unconvinced by the proposed rescue plan.In London, traders in currencies and bonds began their day at 0100 in a special trading session they hoped would let them steal a march on the election result.

For example, the interest rate on two-year Greek bonds fell immediately, from 18.1% to 4.9%.The EU agreement also paved the way for the European Central Bank to start buying government debt, which helped to reduce bond yields.Under the terms of the European loan-guarantee deal, the 16 members of the eurozone will have access to 440bn euros of loan guarantees and 60bn euros of emergency European Commission funding. In addition, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will also contribute up to 250bn euros.The deal is designed to stop Greece's debt crisis spreading to other European countries with high budget deficits, such as Portugal and Spain.Concerns that other countries will be engulfed in the crisis have hit the euro and global shares in recent weeks.""Default risk has been quashed and the market reaction has been euphoric,"" said Jane Foley, research director at Forex.com.But the BBC's economics editor warned that there were still some important questions to be answered, especially about the special purpose vehicle being set up to oversee the 440bn euros being provided by eurozone countries.She said: ""We don't know much about how this special vehicle would work... But if there's any lesson of the past few months it is they[eurozone countries] need to sort it out, fast. ""Investors are going to have plenty of questions about how the vehicle would work.""There were also concerns among investors that the package does nothing to address the fundamental problems of high debt levels in many European countries.

But later trading saw those early gains slowly erase, with the euro trading at $1.2783, and a pound buying 1.1626 euros after the European markets closed - near to its starting point on Monday. The pound is still being affected by uncertainty over which parties will form the next UK government.It fell by a cent against the dollar to $1.48650 immediately after Prime Minister Gordon Brown's announcement that talks had begun between the Liberal Democrats and Labour.Last week's UK general election failed to give any party a clear majority.The main concern is that a weak government will not be able to pass measures to reduce the UK's budget deficit quickly.The pound fell sharply against the dollar on Thursday - the day of the general election - and Friday.

"It may not look like much now, but this in-need-of-attention property is set to be a holiday let for history fans.The Landmark Trust has funding for Llwyn Celyn farmhouse in Monmouthshire, with the aim of restoring its 500-plus years of architectural legacy.The Grade 1 Listed medieval hall house is considered the most significant inhabited ""at risk"" building in Wales. Welsh heritage body Cadw and the National Heritage Memorial Fund (NHMF) gave grants totalling £670,000.Thought to date from around 1480, the property is said to represent key developments in Welsh architecture between the 15th and 18th Centuries and a textbook example of the development of the British manor house. Largely untouched for the past century, the house is in more than six acres (2.6 hectares) of ground, near Llanvihangel Crucorney in the Llanthony Valley, and still has smoke-blackened roofs from its early years - the chimneys and floors were added in the 17th Century.Jennifer Stewart, of the NHMF, said the aim of the work was to ""build up the story and the story book of who lived in the property at different stages"".She said: ""Because it has been in private hands for 100 years, we really don't know that much about it.""Unlike modern houses, we don't know what is behind the panelling. We want to see what this house is like inside and what it was like to live in this house. There's a huge amount to be discovered there.""However, it is thought that the original owner must have been someone of considerable status and wealth and there is possibly a connection with Llanthony Priory which is situated less than six miles away.The Landmark Trust is to begin fundraising for the restoration and the house, which sits within the Brecon Beacons National Park, will be available for rent as holiday accommodation.Ms Stewart added: ""Often the way to preserve [buildings like this] is to find them a use.

"Fewer children are learning to play a musical instrument than in their parents' generation, a survey suggests.One third of children play a musical instrument compared with two thirds of their parents at the same age, research for BBC Worldwide found.And just 44% of the 1,046 parents questioned said it was important for their child to be involved in music.However, other figures suggest the number of pupils learning instruments has risen over the past decade.The most popular instruments for children are the guitar, the keyboard and the recorder.Boys are most likely to learn the guitar (17%), the keyboard (8%) and the drums (7%), while girls are more likely to choose the recorder (11%), followed by the guitar, piano and keyboard (all 9%).The survey, of 1,046 parents with children aged 18 and under, was carried out for BBC Worldwide.It found 64% of children did not play a musical instrument.Among the parents themselves, 34% said they had not played an instrument as a child.The eldest child in a family is the most likely to play an instrument, the research suggests.The UK survey, carried out by ICM, was commissioned in connection with the BBC TV children's music show Zingzillas.Stephanie Cooper, editor of Zingzillas magazine, said: ""As this research shows, fewer children are now learning musical instruments and parents may not be aware of just how beneficial music can be to a child's development.""Young children love responding to music by dancing, singing, creating pictures or talking about what they hear, which gives them creative confidence.""Hearing musical rhythms, patterns and sounds is beneficial for early literacy learning."" Fiona Harvey, education consultant for the Association of British Orchestras, said: ""I find it surprising that these results have come about.""Other research about children learning instruments has suggested that at least 50% of children have learned or are currently learning an instrument.""Opportunities are out there. Perhaps if they [the children in the survey] had an opportunity to learn, they might not have continued. Also, there are lots of informal ways of learning music.""A study by the Institute of Education carried out in England in 2005 found just over 8% of pupils between the ages of five and 16 were learning an instrument in state schools.Among juniors (aged seven to 11) 13% were receiving tuition, researchers found.  Numbers had risen since the early 80s, they said.In 2004, the then Labour government launched a ""music manifesto"", which included the pledge to give every child in England the chance of free or cut-price instrument tuition. A scheme called Wider Opportunities was rolled out in 6,500 schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland which involved children learning to play instruments as a class for free. Fiona Harvey said this had been a ""fantastic initiative"".

"On the pitch Durham are going about a spirited defence of their status as county champions.At the club's Riverside ground Liam Plunkett is running in with some hostility to his bowling. Ian Blackwell is bringing new meaning to the word ""yeomanlike"" with his batting and bowling, and in spite of the north-eastern chill crowds are being counted in their hundreds. But behind the playing scene there are big financial changes going on at the game's newest first-class county. Quietly and without publicity the club has passed into foreign hands.Durham is now more than 90% owned by the Indian media figure Gautam Radia and his brother Hiren. Their stake cost them just short of £2.5m.According to Durham's chief executive David Harker the two are associates of the club's chairman Clive Leach - a former media man himself - and apparently little more than sleeping investors.""They tend not to take a day-to-day interest in the running of the club,"" says Mr Harker.""They don't participate in board meetings. But they are people who have the means, who have an interest in cricket and people who believe in the future of Durham and the future of the stadium.""Mr Harker is also keen to point out that the brothers and Durham have a relationship that goes back to 2008, even if their investment has only now been made public. However, that investment is starting to look rather canny, given Durham's plans to participate in a new domestic 20 over competition. The blueprint is India's Premier League, 20 frenetic overs a side and immensely popular.Durham is part of a group of counties, who own Test match venues, currently examining the structure of county cricket and exploring the prospect of a new Twenty20 tournament - a tournament that could be a big revenue earner.Eight teams would participate on a regional basis. The most likely make-up of a side would have seven home-grown players and four overseas players, most likely Indian - so the rights to the games would be attractive to that country's television broadcasters.It's believed the eight sides would retain a 51% stake in a new franchise. The other 49% would be sold. And anyone buying in would make their money from those Indian TV rights.A previous proposal suggested that each franchise could be sold for £50m, and the tournament could generate £85m when sponsorship, broadcasting and match-day receipts are totted up. Such figures (albeit formulated before the recession took hold) would revolutionise the finances of the clubs involved. In Durham's case it could pave the way to a stock market flotation.""Ultimately that would be something that would be interesting,"" says Mr Harker.""Now there's a lot of work to be done before we ever get to that stage. And we're very much aware of where other organisations have perhaps tried and not gone down that route.""But he says that giving the local community the opportunity to have a stake in the Durham cricket business, when it was fully developed, was something ""very much in the front of our minds"".A flotation would also allow the two Indian investors a profitable exit route.That's for the future though. At the moment Durham are trying to bring in more investment from their own patch. They've already wooed local stockbroker Brewin Dolphin into a  lucrative shirt sponsorship deal.But it needs more. Riverside needs to be developed out to a 20,000 capacity, as an Ashes Test in 2013 is looming.

""There were something like three, maybe four-hundred responses and every one of them was like, 'were you even at the same show?' ""It was so funny, I was laughing so hard. It was like this guy didn't even stay to the end. ""You could not fault that show,"" she rounds off, barely having paused for breath. ""It was amazing.""These are the edited highlights, by the way. Love's description of the gig lasts an entire ten minutes.  In passing, she describes the flights she took to Glasgow, blames Fred Durst for ""ushering in the worst era of rock and roll in history"", and vividly describes her ""mojo"".It is a pure stream of consciousness. No thought, however trifling, remains unspoken. But there is something beguiling about her filthy humour and scattershot enthusiasm. At one point she disappears into a side-room to fetch a Versace couture dress. ""I had this made for the 1996 Oscars,"" she says. ""I always thought I'd get married in it one day but, well...""Although the singer has talked, in frank detail, about her love life in the past, claiming liasions with rock legends like Trent Reznor, Billy Corgan and... er, Bush's Gavin Rossdale, she isn't so forthcoming today.All she will reveal, mysteriously, is that she is ""waiting for a text from a boy"".She is more effusive when I ask about the cover of her new album. Love grabs my copy of the CD and begins a whistle-stop tour of the artwork.""I had Disney make me these shoes, these broken glass slippers,"" she says, pointing at the inside cover, ""and this is a ship at sea that's sinking - which is how I felt making the record. ""This picture is when I was very skinny - I'm almost six feet tall and at this point I'm about 101lbs. No drugs, just total neuroses making this record.""And what about the pictures of Marie Antoinette, Anne Boleyn and Lady Jane Grey? ""The art is pretty-self evident,"" she replies. ""We always seem to get rid of the good dames.""Love is keen to align herself to these historical figures. Strong, misunderstood women, all of whom met a grisly end.She has had her fair share of tough times - from the suicide of her husband Kurt Cobain in 1994, to losing custody of her daughter Frances Bean last year - but she is not ready to give up the fight just yet.The 45-year-old says she has been sober for ""seven years"" and  currently only takes prescription medications. On stage two hours later, she has her old hunger back, opening the show with a low-down and dirty cover of The Rolling Stones' Sympathy For The Devil, before snarling her way through classics like Boys On The Radio, Violet and Doll Parts.As in Glasgow, she demands the house lights be turned up so she can see the whites of the fans' eyes.""Oh that's amazing,"" she beams.
